I've been dancing West Coast Swing for about six months now. I started in I think June in New Orleans, but then I spent August at home and there's no WCS in Des Moines, so I didn't take it up again until October when I rented a place in Boulder. By that time I was in dire need of a refresher.

So I'm learning. And when I learn a thing, **it helps me to try and figure out what the thing *actually is.*** I've written about this before in a post called [*What is Rain?*](/blog/what-is-rain/). Basically what you do is try to cut to the core of an idea and identify the fundamental structure or process underlying it. **The goal is to understand the thing intuitively,** as opposed to just intellectually. It's the difference between 

[*Oppenheimer*](https://youtu.be/qiuSBWVdgLI?si=02sJJod6FA9kdgK6) (the movie, not the human) articulates it beautifully: Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh) says to Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy): *The important thing isn't can you read music, it's can you hear it?* ***Can you hear the music, Robert?***

So this is me trying to "hear the music", as it pertains to dance. It's possible the analogy is so apt it's not even an analogy. "Hearing the music" in dance really means *hearing the music.* There's a reason we don't dance to silence. **Dancing is singing with the body**. Without the music, there is no song to sing.

In that other piece the example was, *What is a car?* And the answer (taken from my poetry professor) was, *A car is a chair with four wheels.*



We're not capturing the idea. We're building the key. **The definition is the key** to the door to the room, and in the room is the idea.

In other words, **you try to see the forest for the trees**.

Metanarratives make stories tangible.

In general, there are two types of knowledge: *declarative knowledge* and *procedural knowledge*. Declarative knowledge is anything you can learn from a book (example: *The sky is blue*). Procedural knowledge is anything you can't learn from a book.

The semantics are a little confusing here: Knowledge, as distinct from understanding. Or information, as distinct from knowledge.

Taoism calls it *conventional knowledge* (knowledge that can be represented with symbols) and...something else.



## What *is* Dance?

Two fish swim past each other. One says, *Mornin' there! How's the water?* The other says, *What's water?*[^1]

It's hard to see an object from inside the object. In dance, it's easy to get lost in the weeds of footwork, frame, and connection. These things matter, but they amount to nothing if you lose sight of the big picture. You can't play with a form if you don't even know it exists.
 
You aren't dancing *to* the music. You're dancing with the music. You're trying to *become* the music. If aliens came down, they should think that the music was coming *from* you. You are the music. You close your eyes and try to take the music inside you, and let it do the dancing.

Okay, that's the individual perspective. But West Coast is a partnered dance. That changes things, but how?

## Dance is Symmetry

When two forces act on each other in equal proportion, you get symmetry. Think of a star and a planet. The planet orbits the star. If the star's gravity were too strong, it'd suck the planet into its core. If the planet were moving too fast, it'd fly off into space. Neither happens, because the relationship between the star's gravity and the planet's speed is symmetrical. It is balanced.

Likewise with dance. The leader is the star, because they remain more or less centered, while the follower "orbits" them. The follower is the planet, because they do all the spinning.

So I think what you have to do is attune yourself to your center of gravity, then attune your center of gravity to your partner's center of gravity. (I assume it's ideal when both partners are trying to do this.) If you can do that, you get symmetry.

How do you attune yourself to your center of gravity? Well, first you have to find it. I'm guessing's everybody's center will be in a slightly different place. Mine hovers just below my solarplexis.

Once you find your center, you dance from it. It's tempting to dance from your feet, because that's how we walk; you move your foot first, then your body follows through. In dance, it's the other way around. Instead of moving your feet first, you move your center first, and simply let your feet come with you. For me, this is challenging. I'm still not very good at it, even after almost six months. But I think it's the right idea.

But when you dance, structure is important, and structure comes from your spine. So to keep your spine straight, you have to engage your core.

I think that's what frame is all about. *Frame* is your body structure.



## Going Forward

If I want to get better at dancing, I'll probably have to deepen my understanding and appreciation for music.
