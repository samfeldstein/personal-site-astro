If you arrived here from the home page, you probably already know that I'm a web developer. If this is news to you, check out the [websites page](/websites/), then kindly [hire me](mailto:samuelfeldstein@proton.me).

What else? We could start with where I'm from, but I'm not going to tell you that. Instead I'll give you a hint: It's not Idaho or Ohio. I'm currently in Boulder, but I've also lived in Iowa City, Southern California, and Far West Texas.

## Hobbies

I used to want to be a [writer](https://notebook.samfeldstein.xyz/notes/published-writing/), but I've mostly given that up. I still write the occasional [blog post](/blog/), and I'm pretty active in [my notebook](https://notebook.samfeldstein.xyz/).

I've been an amateur [photographer](/photos/) for years.

I began taking dance lessons in 2024 after getting fed up with being jealous of how much fun people who knew how to dance were having. I've focussed on West Coast Swing thus far, but I've also taken a handful of Two Step and Country Swing classes.

I like cooking, especially for company. The biggest meal I've ever prepared was a Thanksgiving dinner for ~25 guests. I earned extra points for making two versions of everything: one for normal people, and one for my roommate at the time who was allergic to literally everything except flour and water.

I practice jiu-jitsu, but I'm bad at it.

I want to learn guitar and piano. I took lessons once upon a time, but that was before I learned how to love learning and I didn't stick with it.

Speaking of learning, is that a hobby? I like knowing things because it makes me look smarter than I am. I collect knowledge with [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) and my [notebook](https://notebook.samfeldstein.xyz/).

## Things I Use

### Web Development

A 15-inch MacBook Air (Apple M2, 2023) does everything I need it to do with zero problems. My mouse is an [MX Master 3S for Mac](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/mx-master-3s-mac-bluetooth-mouse.910-006570.html?srsltid=AfmBOoo2Xc7jTQQ4c4zKe8gUs70L2M_3pkXTCLZSvoVpXCdnlWZQNmYi), which is pretty gentle on my fingers and wrists, but I still have a little soreness, so I wear some Walgreens compression gloves which help a ton.

I code in VS Code. I use [GitHub](https://github.com/seldstein/) for version control. I develop in [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and sometimes [Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/). I design in [Figma](https://www.figma.com).

I built this website with [Astro](https://astro.build/), and I built my [notebook](https://notebook.samfeldstein.xyz/) with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev).

### Writing and Reading

I write in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). [Enso](https://enso.sonnet.io/) comes in handy for distraction-free word-dumping. I'd use [beat](https://www.beat-app.fi) if I still wrote screenplays, except maybe not, because [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) has a great [fountain plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=piersdeseilligny.betterfountain).

I track feeds and read articles with [Readwise](https://readwise.io/). For books, I have a Kindle and a library card. The [Internet Archive](https://archive.org) often comes in handy.

Readwise is also where I keep all my annotations. All notes I take in [Readwise Reader](https://read.readwise.io), on my Kindle, or in iBooks show up in my Readwise database, which I export to Google Drive and Obsidian.

I track books I've read and want to read with [LibraryThing](https://www.librarything.com/home).

I memorize information with [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).

### Other

I browse the Web with [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com). I use [Google Programmable Search](https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/about/) to curate results.

I take photos with a [Sony a6000](https://electronics.sony.com/imaging/interchangeable-lens-cameras/aps-c/p/ilce6000l-b?srsltid=AfmBOoq-RLburCCFwOBMuWQ0q0_7j6nLw0aMH20v7ioOyqPar6GfYiqW) and a [7Artisans 35mm lens](https://7artisans.store/products/7artisans-35mm-f1-2-ii). The lens has some vignetting around the edges if you open the aperture too wide, but I think it gives the photos texture.

I have a Toyota Corolla that I've taken all the over the country. If it had cruise control and all-wheel drive, it'd be the perfect vehicle. 80,000 miles and all I've ever done to it is change the oil, swap the battery, and replace the tires.
