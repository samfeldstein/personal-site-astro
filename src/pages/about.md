## Things I Use

I don't write fiction so much anymore, but when I did I used [Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview). For distraction-free word-dumping, I use [Enso](https://enso.sonnet.io/). For writing everything else, taking notes, and managing files, I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) with the [Minimal](https://minimal.guide/home) theme and the following community plugins:

- Hider
- LanguageTool Integration
- Minimal Theme Settings
- Omnivore
- Readwise Official
- Typewriter Mode

My go-to dictionaries are:

- [The Free Dictionary](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/)
- [*Merriam-Webster*](https://www.merriam-webster.com/)
- *The New Oxford American Dictionary* (macOS)
- [Dictionary.com](https://www.dictionary.com/)
- *The Oxford Dictionary of English* (British English, macOS)
- [*Webster's 1913 Dictionary*](https://github.com/cmod/websters-1913) (macOS)
- *Rogetâ€™s Thesaurus*
- [Thesaurus.com](https://www.thesaurus.com/)
- [Online Etymology Dictionary](https://www.etymonline.com/)

I read and annotate articles with [Readwise](https://readwise.io/). I also use Readwise to track feeds. I store my notes and highlights in Obsidian using the plugins mentioned above.

For memorizing facts, quotes, and other information, I use [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) via [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).

For coding, I use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

I built this website with [Astro](https://astro.build/).
