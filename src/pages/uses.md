## Hardware

I'm on the road a lot, so I don't have much of a setup. A 15-inch MacBook Air (Apple M2, 2023) does everything I need it to do with zero problems. My mouse is an [MX Master 3S for Mac](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/mx-master-3s-mac-bluetooth-mouse.910-006570.html?srsltid=AfmBOoo2Xc7jTQQ4c4zKe8gUs70L2M_3pkXTCLZSvoVpXCdnlWZQNmYi), which is pretty gentle on my fingers and wrists, but I still have a little soreness. That could be from typing, though.

I take photos with a [Sony a6000](https://electronics.sony.com/imaging/interchangeable-lens-cameras/aps-c/p/ilce6000l-b?srsltid=AfmBOoq-RLburCCFwOBMuWQ0q0_7j6nLw0aMH20v7ioOyqPar6GfYiqW) and a [7Artisans 35mm lens](https://7artisans.store/products/7artisans-35mm-f1-2-ii). The lens has some vignetting around the edges if you open the aperture too wide, but I think it gives the photos texture.

I have a Toyota Corolla that I've taken all the over the country. If it had cruise control and all-wheel drive, it'd be the perfect vehicle. 80,000 miles and all I've ever done to it is change the oil, swap the battery, and replace the tires.

## Software

### Writing and Reading

I write in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). If I need to manage a lot of text files, as with my [notebook](https://notebook.samfeldstein.xyz), I use [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io).

[Enso](https://enso.sonnet.io/) comes in handy for distraction-free word-dumping. I'd use [beat](https://www.beat-app.fi) if I still wrote screenplays, except maybe not, because VS Code has a great [fountain plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=piersdeseilligny.betterfountain).

I track feeds and read articles with [Readwise](https://readwise.io/). For books, I have a Kindle and a library card. The [Internet Archive](https://archive.org) often comes in handy. I recently switched from [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com) to [LibraryThing](https://www.librarything.com/home) because Goodreads is sluggish and I hate it. LibraryThing is faster and might be open source (I'm not sure, but it has the feel of it).

Readwise is also where I keep all my annotations. All notes I take in [Readwise Reader](https://read.readwise.io), on my Kindle, or in iBooks show up in my Readwise database, which I export to Google Drive.

[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) and [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) help me memorize information.

### Coding

I code in VS Code. I use [GitHub](https://github.com/seldstein/) for version control. I use [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and [Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/) for development. I design in [Figma](https://www.figma.com).

I built this website with [Astro](https://astro.build/), and I built my [notebook](https://notebook.samfeldstein.xyz/index) with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev).

### Other

I browse the Web with [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com).
