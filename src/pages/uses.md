## Writing

At the moment, I'm writing everything in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). There are some advantages to doing so which maybe I'll write about someday.

[Enso](https://enso.sonnet.io/) comes in handy for distraction-free word-dumping. I'd use [beat](https://www.beat-app.fi) if I still wrote screenplays, except maybe not, because VS Code also has a very good [fountain plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=piersdeseilligny.betterfountain).

### Dictionaries

## Reading

I track feeds and read articles with [Readwise](https://readwise.io/).

For books, I have a Kindle and library card. The [Internet Archive](https://archive.org) often comes in handy. I recently switched from [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com) to [LibraryThing](https://www.librarything.com/home) because Goodreads is sluggish and I hate it. LibraryThing, by contrast, is faster, might be open source (I'm not sure, but it has the feel of it), and overall is kind of cool.

## Notetaking

I manage notes and files with VS Code and [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/), but I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to publish them. That's the one thing Obsidian does better than Foam. Foam has a way to do it with GitHub Pages that seems fairly straightforward, but backlinks don't render. I'd love to figure out a way to integrate Foam with Astro, but I'm just not skilled enough at the moment.

I annotate articles and ebooks with Readwise. All notes I take in Readwise, on my Kindle, or in iBooks show up in my Readwise database. I export that database to Obsidian and Google Drive.

For memorizing facts, quotes, and other information, I use [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) via [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).

## Webdev

I code in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). I use [GitHub](https://github.com/seldstein/) for version control. I use [Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/) for development. I design in [Figma](https://www.figma.com). I built this website with [Astro](https://astro.build/).
