## Site

- [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE)
  - Most streamlined way to do this maybe to set up a micro.blog site, then use API to send posts from here to there. Then let micro.blog handle crossposting. And if you use that, you may as well use it's newsletter capabilities anyway.
  - Does Substack have an API?
- Projects page
- Photos page

## Wishlist

- Guestbook
