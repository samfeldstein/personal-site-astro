Hi, I'm **Sam Feldstein**. I used to want to be an [author](/work/#published-writing), but lately I'm more interested in [web development](/work/#web-development). I most recently built the site for [Prairie Rose Arena](https://prairierosearena.com/). I enjoy [blogs](/blogroll/) too much to not have [one of my own](/blog/).
