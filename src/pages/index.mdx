Hi, Iâ€™m **Sam Feldstein**. I used to want to be an [author](#published-writing), but lately I'm more interested in web design. I'm fond of [blogs](#blogroll), [movies](https://letterboxd.com/HoogoSteeglitz/), and [photography](https://www.instagram.com/seldstein/).

I'm **available for hire** as a contract web developer. I most recently built the site for [Prairie Rose Arena](https://prairierosearena.com/).
