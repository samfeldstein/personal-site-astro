title: Site Design

The general idea, to be implemented over time, is that I'll have a few different themes for people to cycle through.

But that's ambitiious, and I should probably assume that whatever the first design I make is is the one I'll have forever.

So how do we start? Well I know I want the website to stand out. I know it I want to be a pleasure to use. Which means it needs to look nice but be fast.

I also know that I appreciate it when websites are easy to navigate and make good use of contrast. So that's a high-level thing to keep in mind.

I like a websitey temrinaly theme for this. But I also like the wild west idea. And the wild west one is definitely less common than the other. When you scroll a directory like the one linked below, the site should stand out. The worst thing it can be is slow, but the second-worst is boring.

- Fantasy
- Wild West
- Pirate (?)
- Movie/Hollywood Theme
