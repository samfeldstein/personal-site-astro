This is not a résumé. Just a list of projects. As you can see, the list is modest. That's because I spent years and years trying to write screenplays, novels, and short stories only to discover that didn't really like writing fiction that much. I began building websites professionally in 2024.

This lame explanation is mostly here because without it the lines under the first and second headings are too close together and it looks weird.
