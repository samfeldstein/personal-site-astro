  ### About

  ### Colophon
  
  - **Design writeup**
    - I hope you won't be put off by the the minimalist style. It is merely a manifestation of my deepest fear: that of self-expression.
    - This is my website. There are many like it, but this one is mine.
    - One page does one thing, and each page is an individual. I had too many ideas for themes that I liked, so I decided to do all of them.
    - Doing a different design for each page saved me the trouble of picking one, which would have been a lot more work in my mind.
    - Overall goal is to build a fun, performant site that works for everyone. That's the standard, but it's not a design framework.
    - My process is basically to mess around until I get something I like.
