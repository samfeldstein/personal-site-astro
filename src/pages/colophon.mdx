  ## Roadmap

  - Cache assets between builds
    - Astro does this locally, but Cloudflare doesn't seem to
      - Esp. important for gallery
  - About the author
  - Code index page
    - Link from contents on home page  
  - Writing index page
    - Link from contents on home page
  - Colophon
    - Write up style and architecture
      - I hope you won't be put off by the the minimalist style. It is merely a manifestation of my deepest fear: that of self-expression.
      - This is my website. There are many like it, but this one is mine.
    - Acknowledgments
      - ~~Fonts~~
  - i18n
  - ~~Add Open Graph metadata.~~
  - ~~Select colors.~~
  - Dynamic blogroll
    - Render from csv
  - Service worker
    - Check [Maggie Appletonâ€™s](maggieappleton.com)
  - Credit other fonts
  - Style blockquotes same as notebook
  - Fun bullets
  - Global Head in resume and everywhere else
  - Small caps on posts
  - One page does one thing, and each page is an individual. I had too many ideas for themes that I liked, so I decided to do all of them.
  - Overall goal is to build a fun, performant site that works for everyone. That's the standard, but it's not a design framework.
  - My process is basically to mess around until I get something I like.
  - Dropcaps in blog page
  - Doing a different design for each page saved me the trouble of picking one, which would have been a lot more work in my mind.
