Designing a website for myself is turning out to be tricky. When I design a site for a client I can say, "Okay, who is this person/business, and what aesthetic fits that." But I'm having a hard time doing that for myself for some reason. Maybe that's because I'm aware of all my facets. Maybe I need to dumb myself down.

So if were going to dumb myself down, I think what I'd do is think about what I enjoy, and what of those things is most relavant to the site. So the answer there, I think, is writing and web design. So if I take those two things, and try to conjure an aesthetic, what I'm come up is modern but literay. A surface that evokes a computer but is pleasing to read on.

So the **intersection between digital and literary** is what I'm going for. Now to find some sites that capture that asethetic.
