## What problem are static site generators solving?

I'm new to web development, but it seems obvious to me that a lot of website builders are bloated. Rather, the final product (the website itself) is bloated, which is what matters.

This is the problem (I think) that SSGs solve. They result in a pure product, one that only consists of the code you put there yourself.

But a lot of SSGS are themselves bloated, from a dev perspective. And I guess what I mean by that is they all come with a ton of stuff (namely node modules) that you may or may not need.

What I'd like is ultimate control over what goes into the backend of my website. No modules I didn't put there.

The other major problem that SSGs solve (I think) is content management. That's why I don't have said dream vanilla setup. As I write this, I'm realizing that I don't actuallly know how any of that content management stuff works. Is it powered by a node modules as well?

Clearly I need to look into this before I can move proceed.
