title: Notes on Storytelling

## Process

The goal is to entertain. Always to entertain. To work the levers of emotion to get the reaction I want.

Copy other writers, don't worry about people finding out. If you're truly paying attention, the story can't help but become unique.

## Structure

Stories have macro-beats and micro-beats. Macro-beats are like a skeleton. They lend a story shape and structure. Micro-beats are everything that covers the skeleton: muscles, ligaments, blood. They are what make the skeleton interesting. As [Stephen Sondheim](https://bookshop.org/p/books/finishing-the-hat-collected-lyrics-1954-1981-with-attendant-comments-principles-heresies-grudges-whines-and-anecdotes-stephen-sondheim/6716906?ean=9780679439073) says, "God is in the details."

Think of music. Think of the first notes of the [*Lord of the Rings*](https://youtu.be/ehAgMszCHU4?si=Ycu5h4ksFoU4tBF0) theme. The skeleton of the measure is: D C D. (The notes could be wrong. I don't play music.) On it's own, not unpleasant, but a little boring. Now add the staccato notes: D C DD C. Open GarageBand and try it. Instantly more interesting. The three notes on their own show potential, but don't have the sound of a finished thing. They are the bones. Adding the second D brings the piece to life.

So with story. Many short stories feel like summaries of longer stories because the author tried to cram a novel into ten pages. Only the bones would fit, and so the piece feels lifeless.

### Symmetries

Two opposing forces buttress each other. That's called symmetry.

## Characters

Characters are defined by their relationships to each other. The protagonist is the opposite of the antagonist. The antagonist is the opposite of the protagonist. It is the fundamental buttressing symmetry.

## Story tropes

- Man betrayed, left for dead, meets a mentor, trains, transforms, returns to exact justice.
