### Writing software

**Variables**

Would support variables, defined in a config file. Useful for changing character names, etc. Wherever you need the name, just insert the varialbe. Then if you need to change the name, you only have to update it in one place.

Note that beat already does this. If anything, you might fork beat instead of building something from scratch.

Then again, I'd like to be able to us VS Code to write. So this might be a plugin instead of an entirely new app.

**Git integration**

So you can see your changes, open a terminal, and push everything all in one place.

A point in favor of making this a VS Code plugin.
