On Friday I officially broke my one-year streak of not going to the Iowa State Fair, which is a streak I hate to maintain for any length of time. I don't really have happy places, but if I did the fair would be one of them.

The fair is an annual event and lasts for eleven days. 

But it only happens once a year for eleven days, and since of those eleven days we'll probably only go three times (this year is an exception. We have a bunch of family coming into town, and then more the following week, so I've already been twice.)

We attended the fair every year when I was a kid, though my earliest memories of it don't go back very far. I think that's because my brain can't distinguish any of the twenty-five-ish fairs I've attended and so instead of catologuing a highlight reel of memories it merged them all into one giant meta-fair, a mental representation of what I think the fair is and how I feel about it. And since that meta-fair pretty much feels like joy, I've concluded that I must like it, and since I like it, I've concluded that I must owe it something, and that something is effort.

Why effot?

Because it takes work to make life good. This is one of the things I've learned in the last three or four years or so. It takes work to make life good. Not always. I guess you don't need to put much work in to have a good time playing a video game, but then again maybe if you want to get the most out of it, to have the *most* fun, maybe you do need to strategize some. I guess that depends on the game, and whether or not you like to set your own goals. I think setting your own goals is always going to be more satisfying than letting someone else set them for you.

Strategizing the fair is not a new concept in our family, but it's one in which I've never really partaken. My brother is  the stratetgist in the family, but so far as I know he hasn't written any of this down, and since I don't feel like reinventing the wheel every year, I figure I'll take the liberty, and even if he had written something down I doubt his needs would serve mine on every count. It's in that spirit that I recommend every draft their own State Fair battle plan.

In any case, I guess what I'm trying to say is that this is an opportunity to sort of gamify life, and in this case we're playing a team sport. I think it's best to set a concrete objective. So one might be, eat as many different foods as possible. So okay, how do we go about that?

Maybe one section is rules up top, then specific map as to where to go, when and in what order, after that. And you can have a general guide but really the best thing to do is base it around the events you want to see. But it's sort of an ourbourous. Cause you might plan what events you can see around where you are in space at any given time.

I guess the idea is both to be efficient and also puts faith in the idea that putting in a little more effort on the input side of things will increase the desired output (in this case, fair-fun) by an order of mangnitude or more. In general, I vasciallate between strategizing and winging it, but winging it does so often feel empty and I have to say I come down on the strategizing side of things more often than not.

## Ground Rules

First of all, you have to share. You cannot expect to eat a full portion of everything you want to try, or you'll only be able to try like three things.

Also, sit. The fairgrounds are huge, and a day spent at the fair is a day spent walking.

Bring a bag. A small backpack is best. This rule especially applies if you have children.

## The Food

First thing's first. 

Every year the fair releases a list of new foods, which is definitely their best and possibly their last marketing gimmick.[^1] In any case, it's the only one anybody cares about, probably because it's the one that involves eating.

You could as much say the fair is a hedonic outlet for people who like to eat as much as Burning Man is for people who like to do drugs and have sex. (Or so I imagine. I've never been to burning man.)

I've never been a foodie, (that's my brother's purview) but one of the chief joys of the fair is the food, and it is in fact a crucial part of the experience. A day at a fair is a day of walking. To walk, you need energy. If that energy happens to come in the form of a Gaint Mocha Bar from the Bauder's ice cream stand, so be it. So you not only get to indugle yourself but you get to rightfully call it a matter of survival. If that's not a win-win, I don't know what is.

## Ethusiasm takes effort

<!-- Need a natural flow here. Not a sudden. But suddnely you look around and you realize you're in skidrow. -->

I'm not an enthusiast about basically anything (the best I can seem to muster these days is a mild interset) and the fair is no exception. 

I'm not an enthusaisast about the fair and I guess this fair is no exception. About many things that is, and the fair is no exception. I don't know what that's about. I guess it has something to do with some combination of getting older and the too much of a good thing killing the goodness of the thing. I've always been a repeat customer. I like to watch the same movies over and over again, for instance, because I don't like risk and it's a certain kind of risk to watch something new, because you might not like it I consider that a waste of time. So why not just watch something I know I like? Well, htere is a downside to that and I think it's one we're all familiar with. When you watch the same movie too many times, it gets boring. You chip away at the story's ability to surprise you with every viewing. Pretty soon the prosepct of watching it feels like a drag, doesn't provoke excitement or anticipation but a kind of lethargic dread. And pretty soon you'll start to lament the fact that you used to enjoy certain things so much and now you find yourself actively trying to enjoy (more than you presumably do organically). That's sad.

I want to love these movies and the fair the same way I did when I was a kid. Unselfconsciously, fully, when I wasn't worried about whether or not I was enjoying them enough. I like the parts I liked and I liked the parts I didn't like, and I was honest about both.

Maybe there's something to that last part. Maybe I'm not honest enough with myself anymorea bout letting me not like the parts I don't like of things I mostly like. When I was little I used to love the Sons of Katie Elder, but all told it's a pretty boring movie and I must have felt this way even then because I'd always fast forward to the good parts, especially the gunfight at the end. Now I'm old enough toe understand that the boring parts are necessary to make the story mean something, and in fact I don't find them so boring anymore. I actually that's an underrrated movie, and uniqiue in its subject matter and therefore its poignancy. But all this to say I don't tlove things the way I did when I was little. I don't love movies the way I did when I was little, I don't love stories the way I did when I was little. I tried to read several fantasy books this summer, and even the ones that were well-written I just couldn't become invested in them. My mind would wander as I read. There was none of that old sense of being captivated by the story. I couldn't fall into it. I love that feeling of falling in, whatever it is. Falling into a story or falling in love. Exisitence seemed more complete back then, somehow, and maybe that's just because it was simpler. I wasn't thinking too much, or at least I don't remember doing so, and so I had nothing to focus on wbut what was in front me, and i got lost in it.

I think drugs can help here. I think getting high or taking mushrooms returns you to something like a childlike state in the sense that severything becomes much more powerful. A child can't tell the difference between a real dinosaur and an animotonic one. That's why that T-rex in south dakota scare the shit out of so many kids. The part of their brain that can distingusi hfiction from reality hasn't developed yet, and so to them, the dinosaur is very real, or at least more real than it is to grown ups, who are able to look at it and laugh.

That said, adults who can't tell the difference between fiction and reality scare me. I bet some of them scare you, too. Think of the QAnon people, or people who put too much stock in astrology (which is to say, any stock at all) (of cousre, they "don't take it seriously," except they obviously do and feel that it's a real point of connection, and maybe in so thiknking it becomse and actual point of connection ,but still, the willfull ignorance is baffling and terrifying and I find it revolting). And yes, people who believe in God and have nutty ideas (a litteral god that is) and have nutty ideas about the afterlife fall into this category as well (which is to say, they bleieve in an afterlife at all). These people terrify me, because they're litterally living in another reality. Henrick Karlsson once put it that everybody has a different headset on, and some people's headset shows them monsters that aren't there. And you wish so badly you could take the headset off and tell them, look, see nothing to be afraid of. But what do you when the maybe the headset is actually a defense against the real monster, which is deaf. The headset doesn't show fictional monsters, but hides the very real one. (They consider it a monser, not me). 

I'm not saying I see perfectly clearly. We are all wearing headsets. But some people make an attempt to calibrate, some don't. Some do but are so overcome by bias, and moreso to the point that they don't even know biasses exist (one time someone tried to defend astrology, and when I mentioend burden of proof, they said, "What's that?") 

It doesn't help that it's taboo to tell people their ideas are insane, because that's tanatmount to telling them they're insane. Or at least stupid. And I agree that calling anybody stupid isn't going to change anybody's mind, but I wish more people felt less attached to speicific ideas and more attached the ideal of truth. That way, we don't invest so much of ourselves in beliefs, but rather in the pursuit of truth. This way, rexamination of beliefs becosme integral to who we are. and actually, maybe the idea of belief goes out the window entirely, because in order to believe something you have to have drawn a conclusion that you now hold to be truth. But maybe it's less about saying, Okay, this true, as opposed to, Okay, I think thisk might be true, so I'm going to treat it as an assumption until I see evidence to the contrary.

One solution to this is to share things you love with people. Just as we glom onto characters in stories, we glom onto people that we care about and so experience things through them. That's why if your girlfriend isnt' having such a good time at this concert, you aren't going to either, even if you love the music. Because a part of you is her, and that part of you (her) doesn't like it.

So that's why when you watch a movie you've seen a thousand times with someone you love, assuming they've never seen it, a part of you epxeriences it for hte first itme. 

So this might be one argument for having children. I've never though that having children for the sake of having children, or to save a marriage, is a good idea. But there might be something to idea of having children in order to reinvigorate your enthusaism for living. Because you get to epxiernece life all over again, through their eyes. The quesiton reamins as to whether that's a reason to have kids in itself, or just a happy and deeply meaninful side effect of doing so. Or maybe it's our built in incentive to have kids in the first place. Maybe it's a little trick nature is pulling. You lose your ability to enjoy life as you get older, so you have kids in order to reclaim it, to feel that again. Which would mean that desire is pretty strong.

You know, I'm saying all this about kids bringing new joy to life, insofar as you live vicariously through them essentially, which could easily be very dangerous, but I'm trying to stay on topic here, so let's table that but the point I'm trying to make is that that actually wasn't my experience with these kids, because they didn't feel like doing any of the things I liked. For the most part. They wanted to ride rides, for example. I personall consider the midway to be hell on earth. So do my parents presumably, because though we went to the fair every year when I was a kid I don't think I knew the midway exsited until I was in high school, and even then I never set foot on it. It may as well have been a foreign country, and I kind of still feel that way about it.

Anyway, so all that's to say that having kids clearly isn't to be all roses, and it's probably for the bestthat I'm realizing this now. I already knew it, of course, because my own nightmarish behvaior as a child is still fresh in my memory, but it's good to have the experience to back up the knowledge.

So knowing that, where do we go from there? I guess you have to ask yourself to what extent you want to try to actively influence your child's interests. I don't see anything with steering them toward the things you enjoy, and because presumably the things you are things you consider to be good for the soul. So while not alturistic, that still seems good.

On a deeper level ,what does it mean to work to enjoy something. What does it mean to try to be enthusaistic about something? If you have to try, are you really all that enthusaistic about ti? Do you really like it all that much to begin with? You must not. And if you don't, why bother trying to get excited about it in the first place?

Anyway, here are my fair food selections:

## The Old Standbys

*Bauder's ice cream.* (We used to be faithful patrons at the dairy barn, but my parents jumped shippped when shakes went up to seven dollars. Bauder's was presumably cheaper at the time, but I don't know that they are now.)

- Barksdale's cookies
- Kettle Corn
- Corn Dog
- Millers Mini Donuts
- Pickle Dog
- Honey Lemonade
- Hot Beef Sundae

- Xtreme tenderloin?


## New Foods

- Bacon Cheeseburger Egg Roll

## Footnotes

[^1]: The theme used to be a pretty good gimmick but it seemed like it was the same one (Nothing Compares!) for a number of years running so now I don't even bother to check, and since I'm operating on the assumption that I'm a pretty good litmus test for the average fairgoer, I'm going to go ahead and say that no one else cares either. That's to say I *wouldn't* care if they started getting creative again, but you better do something to catch my eye if you do, becaues I'm not going to go out of my way to find out.

## Bin

To be clear, I'm not happy about this. One of the more annoying things about growing up is that it now takes effort to enjoy things that used to be effortlessly joyful. [You'll need concrete examples, otherwise this is for nought and might not actually be the point you're trying to make.] I don't know if that's because when you're a kid your parents are putting in the effort for you, or because kids are easier to please than adults. Or maybe it has something to do with the general flattening of emotion that accompanides adulthood. I don't know why this flattening happens, but I'm going to go way out on a limb and guess it has something to do with brain development. Any case, I'm not concerned with its causes here, but its effects, and for me, this flattening has on the whole been a good thing. I'm calmer than I used to be, and I'm not so angry, and I fall asleep almost immediately on an almost regular basis. But I have this theory that all feelings, positive or negative, enter us by the same channel. So if negative feelings have less of a hold on me than they used to, it only follows that positive ones do, too. If my capacity for fear is reduced, then so is my capacity for joy.

So what happens in childhood through young adulthood, before you're very wise, is that you spend all this time trying to shut out of the bad emotions while having no idea that you're also blocking out the good ones, then you get older and start to wonder why you don't feel things so strongly as you used to, and after some time thinking about it you realized what you've done and have to start working the other way, to open the channel again. How exactly you do that, I'm afraid I can't say.

Except, what does that look like? Does it mean wearing your emotions on your sleeve all the time? Cause that's kind of a buzzkill. So that really can't be the answer, but that just feels like being a child again. Maybe a better path is realizing that those negative feelings don't really matter so much. Nothing has really changed, after all, if you do get rained, other than that you're a little wet. But can we have it both ways? If we say, the little negetaive things don't matter, don't we also have to say that the positive ones don't either? If you have a good time eating corndogs and people watching, that's great, but you also have to admit that nothing has really changed after the fact. You haven't exactly grown from that experience, at least not in the sense that we mean. But who really grows from anything without reflection? Is that the whole point of writing, to spur growth? To reflect on and learn from experience, and then to move forward armed with newfound wisdom? 


So what I'm getting is, hedonism is fine so long as you reflect on it after the fact. But upon reflecting on it, don't be surprised if you find out that hedonism isn't fine, after all.

Or maybe the appropriate conclusion is that it's fine in certain contexts. The fair, for example. You could as much say the fair is a hedonic outlet for people who like to eat as much as Burning Man is for people who like to do drugs and have sex. (Disclaimer: I've never been the burning man.)

Maybe there comes a time in our relationship with something that brings us joy when can't only take from it any longer, and we have to start giving back. Maybe the person you love used to make you fly, but now the honeymoon phase is over and you have to make an effort to keep things interesting. I'm sure there's something going on there that has to do with chemicals. But the point is that it's the same with hobbies and events. I've taken much joy from the fair for many many years. Now it's time to start giving some back, to put in some effort in order to make it good. And I don't mean working there (though I have done that) or volunteering or in any way becoming involved with the administrative side of things, though that would be a valid and noble way to return the joy (in short, work to keep it alive and well, so that it can keep bringing joy to others).
