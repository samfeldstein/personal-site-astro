Hi, I'm **Sam Feldstein**. I used to want to be an [author](#published-writing), but lately I'm more interested in [web design](/projects/).

## Things I Use

### Writing

I like playing with new tools, so I cycle through quite a few of them. At the moment, I'm writing everything in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). There are some advantages to doing so which maybe I'll write about someday.

[Enso](https://enso.sonnet.io/) comes in handy for distraction-free word-dumping. I'd use [beat](https://www.beat-app.fi) if I still wrote screenplays, except maybe not, because VS Code also has a very good [fountain plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=piersdeseilligny.betterfountain).

#### Dictionaries

In order of consultation.

- *The New Oxford American Dictionary* (macOS)
- [*Merriam-Webster*](https://www.merriam-webster.com/)
- [The Free Dictionary](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/)
- *The Oxford Dictionary of English* (British English, macOS)

#### Thesauruses

- [Thesaurus.com](https://www.thesaurus.com/)
- *Rogetâ€™s Thesaurus*

#### Use less, but not useless

- [Online Etymology Dictionary](https://www.etymonline.com/)
- [*Webster's 1913 Dictionary*](https://github.com/cmod/websters-1913) (macOS)

### Reading

I track feeds and read articles with [Readwise](https://readwise.io/).

For books, I have a Kindle and library card. The [Internet Archive](https://archive.org) often comes in handy. I recently switched from [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com) to [LibraryThing](https://www.librarything.com/home) because Goodreads is sluggish and I hate it. LibraryThing, by contrast, is faster, might be open source (I'm not sure, but it has the feel of it), and overall is kind of cool.

### Notetaking

I manage notes and files with VS Code. I used to use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), which is excellent software, but there wasn't anything I was doing with it that I couldn't do as well or better with VS Code.

I annotate articles and ebooks with Readwise. All notes I take in Readwise, on my Kindle, or in iBooks show up the Readwise database. I used to export that database to Obsidian but now I send them to Google Drive.

For memorizing facts, quotes, and other information, I use [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) via [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).

### Web design

I code in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). I use [GitHub](https://github.com/seldstein/) for version control. I use [Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/) for development. I built this website with [Astro](https://astro.build/).

I design in [Figma](https://www.figma.com).
