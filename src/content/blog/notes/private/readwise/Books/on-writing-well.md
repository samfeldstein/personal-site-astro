> “What if you’re feeling depressed or unhappy?” a student asked. “Won’t that affect your writing?” Probably it won’t, I said. If your job is to write every day, you learn to do it like any other job.


> Any method that helps you to say what you want to say is the right method for you.


> If you find that writing is hard, it’s because it is hard.


> Writers must relax, and they must have confidence.


> Every writing project must be reduced before you start to write.


> Trust your material if it’s taking you into terrain you didn’t intend to enter but where the vibrations are good. Don’t fight such a current if it feels right.


> Don’t become the prisoner of a preconceived plan. Writing is no respecter of blueprints.


> Every writer must follow the path that feels most comfortable.


> My commodity as a writer, whatever I’m writing about, is me. And your commodity is you. Don’t alter your voice to fit your subject. Develop one voice that readers will recognize when they hear it on the page, a voice that’s enjoyable not only in its musical line but in its avoidance of sounds that would cheapen its tone: breeziness and condescension and clichés.


> Never hesitate to imitate another writer. Imitation is part of the creative process for anyone learning an art or a craft.


> “The reader has to feel that the writer is feeling good, even if he isn’t.”


> I’m often dismayed by the sludge I see appearing on my screen if I approach writing as a task—the day’s work—and not with some enjoyment.


> Writers who write interestingly tend to be men and women who keep themselves interested. That’s almost the whole point of becoming a writer. If you write about subjects you think you would enjoy knowing about, your enjoyment will show in what you write. Learning is a tonic.


> If the process is sound, the product will take care of itself.


> Don’t visualize the finished product: the grand edifice you have vowed to construct. That will only make you anxious.
