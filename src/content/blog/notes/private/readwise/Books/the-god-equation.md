> If we had a microscope powerful enough,

If we assume things get infinitely, why wouldnt we assuume they get infinitely small?


> The critics, however, pointed out that direct evidence for atoms was impossible to acquire because they were too small to be observed. But Democritus could point out compelling, indirect evidence. Consider a gold ring, for example. Over the years, the ring begins to wear down. Something is being lost. Every day some tiny bits of matter have been worn off the ring. Hence, although atoms are invisible, their existence can be measured indirectly.


> Unfortunately, with the collapse of classical civilization, these philosophical discussions and debates were lost. The concept that there could be a paradigm explaining the universe was forgotten for almost a thousand years. Darkness spread over the Western world, and scientific inquiry was largely replaced by belief in superstition, magic, and sorcery.

Worth remembering it could happen again.


> Although Edison was the mastermind behind electricity and one of the architects of the modern world, he did not fully understand Maxwell’s equations. This would be a very costly mistake. In fact, he thumbed his nose at scientists who knew too much mathematics. (In a famous story, he would often ask scientists looking for a job to calculate the volume of a light bulb. He would smile as these scientists tried to use advanced mathematics to tediously calculate the shape of the light bulb and then its volume. Afterward, Edison would simply pour water into an empty light bulb and then pour it into a graduated beaker.)


> Berg attended a talk Heisenberg gave in Zurich, with orders to kill the physicist if Berg thought that the German bomb effort was near completion. (This story is elaborated in Nicholas Dawidoff’s book The Catcher Was a Spy.)


> This is called black hole evaporation and describes the ultimate fate of all black holes: they will gently radiate Hawking radiation for trillions of years, until they exhaust all their radiation and die in a fiery explosion. So even black holes have a finite lifetime.


> There is this famous line in T. H. White’s novel The Once and Future King: “Everything not forbidden is compulsory.” Physicists actually take this statement seriously. Unless there is a physical law against a phenomenon, perhaps it exists somewhere in the universe.


> Some physicists have seriously proposed the controversial idea that when stars fall into a black hole, they are not crushed into a singularity but instead are blown out the other side of a wormhole, creating a white hole. A white hole obeys precisely the same equations as a black hole, except the arrow of time is reversed, so matter spews out of a white hole. Physicists have looked for white holes in space, but so far have turned up empty-handed. The point of mentioning white holes is that perhaps the Big Bang was originally a white hole, and all the stars and planets we see in the heavens were flung out of a black hole—about fourteen billion years ago.


> To Einstein, however, time was more like a river. It could speed up or slow down as it meandered its way across stars and galaxies.


> Hawking was so fascinated by time travel that he issued a challenge to other physicists. He believed there must be a hidden law of physics, not yet found, that he called the chronology protection conjecture, which ruled out time travel once and for all. But try as he might, he could never prove this hypothesis. This means that time travel might still be consistent with the laws of physics, with nothing to prevent the existence of time machines.


> The implications of inflation are far-reaching. It means that the visible universe that we see around us is actually a tiny, infinitesimal piece of a much larger universe, one that we will never see because it is so far away.


> Surprisingly, the amount of dark energy in the universe is enormous. More than 68.3 percent of all matter and energy in the universe is in this mysterious form. (Collectively, dark energy and dark matter comprise most of the matter/energy, but they are two distinct entities and should not be confused with each other.)


> Today, history may be repeating itself. Once again we have two great pillars of physics. On one hand, we have the theory of the very big, Einstein’s theory of gravity, which gives us black holes, the Big Bang, and the expanding universe. On the other hand, we have the theory of the very small, the quantum theory, which explains the behavior of subatomic particles. The problem is that they stand in conflict with each other. They are based on two different principles, two different mathematics, and two different philosophies.
