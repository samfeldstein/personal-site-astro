> It’s important to understand what that means. It means that if anyone asks you to loan them money or to invest with them over the long term, they better expect to pay you more than 6 percent a year. Why? Because you can get 6 percent a year without taking any risk. All you have to do is lend money to the U.S. government, and they’ll guarantee that you receive your 6 percent each and every year, along with all of your money back after 10 years. If Jason wants money for a share of his gum business, that investment better earn you more than 6 percent per year, or no way should you do it! If Jason wants to borrow money over the long term, same deal. He better expect to pay you a lot more than 6 percent. After all, you can get 6 percent risk free by lending to the U.S. government!


> Your 10,000 shares, or 1 percent ownership, of Jason’s Gum Shops means that you would be entitled to 1 percent of the future earnings of the entire Jason’s Gum Shops business. Now, of course, all you would have to do is figure out whether paying $120,000 for 1 percent of Jason’s future gum profits is a good deal.


> So, here’s what you need to know: 1. Buying a share in a business means you are purchasing a portion (or percentage interest) of that business. You are then entitled to a portion of that business’s future earnings. 2. Figuring out what a business is worth involves estimating (okay, guessing) how much the business will earn in the future. 3. The earnings from your share of the profits must give you more money than you would receive by placing that same amount of money in a risk-free 10-year U.S. government bond. (Remember: Last chapter we set 6 percent as your absolute minimum annual return when government bond rates fall below 6 percent)


> The truth is that I don’t really have to know why people are willing to buy and sell shares of most companies at wildly different prices over very short periods of time. I just have to know that they do!


> It is a good idea to buy shares of a company at a big discount to your estimated value of those shares. Buying shares at a large discount to value will provide you with a large margin of safety and lead to safe and consistently profitable investments.


> earns a 50 percent return on capital or one that earns a 2.5 percent return on capital? Of course, the answer is obvious—and that’s the second point! You would rather own a business that earns a high return on capital than one that earns a low return on capital!


> Combining points 1 and 2, buying good businesses at bargain prices is the secret to making lots of money.


> Graham’s formula involved purchasing companies whose stock prices were so low that the purchase price was actually lower than the proceeds that would be received from simply shutting down the business and selling off the company’s assets in a fire sale


> Graham stated that it seems “ridiculously simple to say” that if one could buy a group of 20 or 30 companies that were cheap enough to meet the strict requirements of his formula, without doing any further analysis, the “results should be quite satisfactory.” In fact, Graham used this formula with much success for over 30 years.


> In other words, what would happen if we decided to only buy shares in good businesses (ones with high returns on capital) but only when they were available at bargain prices (priced to give us a high earnings yield)? What would happen? Well, I’ll tell you what would happen: We would make a lot of money!


> The formula isn’t looking for the company that ranks best on return on capital or the one with the highest earnings yield. Rather, the formula looks for the companies that have the best combination of those two factors.


> the companies that receive the best combined rankings are the ones that have the best combination of both factors.


> Often, small companies have very few shares available for purchase, and even a small amount of demand for those shares can push share prices higher. If that’s the case, the formula may look great on paper, but in the real world, the fantastic results can’t be replicated. That’s why it’s important that the companies chosen by the magic formula be pretty large.


> The point is that if the magic formula worked all the time, everyone would probably use it. If everyone used it, it would probably stop working. So many people would be buying the shares of the bargain-priced stocks selected by the magic formula that the prices of those shares would be pushed higher almost immediately. In other words, if everyone used the formula, the bargains would disappear and the magic formula would be ruined!


> As a professional manager, if you do poorly while everyone else is doing well, you run the risk of losing all your clients and possibly your job! Many managers feel the only way to avoid that risk is to invest pretty much the way everyone else does. Often this means owning the most popular companies, usually the ones whose prospects look most promising over the next few quarters or the next year or two.


> In other words, owning a business that has the opportunity to invest some or all of its profits at a very high rate of return can contribute to a very high rate of earnings growth!


> But here’s the thing. If capitalism is such a tough system, how does the magic formula find us companies that are able to earn a high return on capital in the first place? To earn a high return on capital even for one year, it’s likely that, at least temporarily, there’s something special about that company’s business. Otherwise, competition would already have driven down returns on capital to lower levels.


> Most people and businesses can’t find investments that will earn very high rates of return. A company that can earn a high return on capital is therefore very special.


> Following the formula for any three-year period in a row, the magic formula beat the market averages 95 percent of the time (160 out of 169 three-year periods tested)!


> Over three-year periods, if you followed the magic formula, you would never have lost money. That’s right. Sticking with the magic formula for any three-year period during those 17 years, you would have made money 100 percent of the time


> What is the risk of losing money following that strategy over the long term? 2. What is the risk that your chosen strategy will perform worse than alternative strategies over the long term?


> Over the short term, Mr. Market acts like a wildly emotional guy who can buy or sell stocks at depressed or inflated prices. • Over the long run, it’s a completely different story: Mr. Market gets it right.


> if you buy shares at what you believe to be a bargain price and you are right, Mr. Market will eventually agree and offer to buy those shares at a fair price. In other words, bargain purchases will be rewarded. Though the process doesn’t always work quickly, two to three years is usually enough time for Mr. Market to get things right.


> Choosing individual stocks without any idea of what you’re looking for is like running through a dynamite factory with a burning match. You may live, but you’re still an idiot.


> Well, the answer is that the magic formula doesn’t pick individual stocks, either. It picks many stocks at one time. Looking at a whole portfolio of stocks, it turns out that using last year’s earnings is often a good indicator of what earnings will look like in the future. Of course, for individual companies, this may not be the case. But on average, last year’s earnings will often provide a pretty good estimate for normal earnings going forward. That’s why, if we actually use the magic formula, we’ll want to own 20 or 30 stocks at one time. In the magic formula’s case, we want the average (that is, the average return for a portfolio of stocks chosen by the magic formula). Since average results for the magic formula will, hopefully, mean extraordinary investment returns, owning many different stocks chosen by the magic formula should help ensure that we stay pretty close to that average.


> If you still want to buy individual stocks despite all the warnings, don’t even try to make a lot of predictions. Limit your stock investments to a small number of “good” companies that are available at bargain levels. For those few investors who are capable of estimating normal earnings several years into the future and placing values on businesses, owning just a handful of bargain-priced stocks is the best way to go. As a general rule of thumb, if you are truly doing good research and have a good understanding of the companies that you purchase, owning just five to eight stocks in different industries can safely make up at least 80 percent of your total portfolio.


> Rather than just blindly choosing stocks that catch your fancy or blindly accepting the output of the magic formula, how about combining both strategies? Start with the magic formula and put together a list of top-ranked stocks. Then choose a few of your favorites by whatever method you want. You must, however, choose solely from the top 50 or 100 stocks as ranked by the magic formula.23 Using this method, you should still place at least 10 to 30 stocks in your portfolio (the lower end of this range if you actually know something about evaluating businesses and the higher end if you are choosing stocks based on birth signs). And that should do it.


> In short, for the few who have the ability, knowledge, and time to predict normal earnings and evaluate individual stocks, owning less can actually be more—more profits, more safety . . . and more fun!


> For individual stocks in which we are showing a loss from our initial purchase price, we will want to sell a few days before our one-year holding period is up. For those stocks with a gain, we will want to sell a day or two after the one-year period is up. In that way, all of our gains will receive the advantages of the lower tax rate afforded to long-term capital gains (a maximum 15 percent tax rate under federal guidelines for stocks held more than one year), and all of our losses will receive short-term tax treatment (a deduction against other sources of income that otherwise could have been taxable at rates up to 35 percent). Over time, this minor adjustment can add significantly to our after-tax investment returns.


> Lastly, be aware that getting started will be the hardest part. We probably don’t want to buy all 30 stocks at once. To reproduce the results from our tests, we will have to work into our magic formula portfolio over the course of our first year of investing. That means adding 5 to 7 stocks to our portfolio every few months until we reach 20 or 30 stocks in our portfolio. Thereafter, as stocks in our portfolio reach the one-year holding mark, we will replace only the 5 to 7 stocks that have been held for one year. If that’s a little confusing, don’t worry, step-by-step instructions are about to follow.
