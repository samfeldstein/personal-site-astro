> For me, math is also about making something myself: it’s about making truth myself. It’s about being self-sufficient out in the wild world of ideas. This, to me, is an immensely exciting, daunting, awe-inspiring, and ultimately joyful experience, and this is what I want to describe.


> This is not a math textbook, nor is it a math history book. It’s a math emotions book.


> this image of a rigid world with clear answers is a very limited view of what math is like. Abstract math really doesn’t have such clear right-and-wrong answers, especially not at a research level, but only a small proportion of people ever make it to that stage to see what it’s really like. And the extraordinary thing is that those mathematicians often love math for the same reasons that math-phobic people dislike it: they are interested in subtlety and nuance, to express and explore what is most interesting about life. Deep down, math isn’t about clear answers, but about increasingly nuanced worlds in which we can explore different things being true.


> Trying to get everyone to meet the standards needed for mathematical jobs would be like teaching children cooking as if they’re all training to be line cooks in a professional kitchen. Instead it’s better (in both cases, I suspect) to show them the possibilities, nurture enjoyment and curiosity, and trust that they can learn the more precise skills later if they need and want to.
