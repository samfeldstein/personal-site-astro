> THE DELEGATES TO the First Zionist Congress had come to Basel from across the globe. From Britain and America, from Palestine and from Arab lands, from Russia, Germany, France, and more, the 197 delegates had gathered in Switzerland with the sense that they were making history. It was August 1897,

> After almost eighteen months of planning, Herzl had made sure that the congress would be a stately affair. He wanted the congress’s magnificence to announce the launch of a grand new political movement when it opened on August 29, 1897.


> One of the crowning achievements of the congress was a clear definition of the goals of the newly organized movement. The Zionist program, which was drafted after days of impassioned debate about its exact wording, eventually read as follows: Zionism seeks to secure for the Jewish people a publicly recognized, legally secured homeland in Palestine. . . .


> The congress also adopted an anthem. Written in 1878, “Hatikvah” (in a version much briefer than the original) is a simple anthem, composed of but one sentence: As long as deep in the heart, the soul of a Jew yearns, and onwards, towards the end of the East, an eye still gazes towards Zion, our hope is not yet lost; the hope of two thousand years, to be a free nation in our land, the land of Zion and Jerusalem.*


> When the Lord restored the fortunes of Zion, we were like those who dreamed. —Psalm 126 Though it is commonly said that those delegates from around the world who gathered in Basel for the First Zionist Congress in 1897 were the people who created the Zionist movement, that is not entirely true. The participants in the First Zionist Congress launched Zionism as a political movement. But the dream at the core of their movement, the yearning to return to their ancestral home in the Land of Israel, had originated much earlier. It was a dream as old as the Jewish people itself.

> The first wave of Jewish immigration, known as the First Aliyah, began in 1882 and continued, with breaks, until 1903.*


> The influx of European Zionists alarmed the Jews already living in Palestine, commonly known as the Old Yishuv. The Old Yishuv Jews were pious to the core and deeply loyal to their rabbinic authorities. To them, the new, ideologically ultrasecular Yishuv seemed alien, even blasphemous.


> Sometimes also called the “godfather of the moshavot,”* Rothschild sent European agricultural experts to Palestine to advise the newly arrived immigrants, and he acquired extensive land holdings there. All told, he purchased about two hundred square miles of land, on which some forty villages were established.


> SHORTLY AFTER THE KISHINEV POGROM and then the rapid rise and fall of the Uganda Plan, the Second Aliyah (1904–1914) began.


> In 1909, Tel Aviv was born. “Tel Aviv” was the title of the Hebrew translation of Herzl’s utopian novel, Altneuland.*


> The Zion Mule Corps, the first organized group of Jews to fight under a Jewish flag since Bar Kokhba had led his revolt against the Romans some eighteen hundred years earlier,


> Chaim Weizmann, who would later become Israel’s first president.


> “His Majesty’s Government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.”


> The Jewish community’s democratic impulse had developed after exile. Forced to wander from their ancestral homeland to places throughout Europe, they continually had to build communal structures from scratch. Beginning in 1580 and continuing until 1764, the Council of Four Lands (based in Lublin, Poland) served as the central locus of Jewish authority for Greater Poland, Little Poland, Ruthenia, and Volhynia. This elected council dealt with matters such as taxation, relations with the outside Gentile community, and more. The Council of Four Lands, as well as smaller and more local councils throughout European Jewish communities, were all democratically elected. That pattern was replicated by the Zionist congresses. By the early twentieth century, European Jews had been voting, legislating, and taxing themselves for some 350 years.


> Yet even as the Yishuv was learning to defend itself, it suffered a serious diplomatic blow. In 1921, just four years after the Balfour Declaration and one year after Balfour was included in the San Remo Resolutions, Winston Churchill, who had been appointed Secretary of State for the Colonies and who had until then been seen as a friend of the Zionists, decided to redraw the map of the Middle East without consulting his Zionist allies.22 He carved away the portion of Palestine that was east of the Jordan River and created the country of Transjordan (later called Jordan).

Remember that Jordan was created only just before Israel.


> Unlike “Hatikvah,” the anthem of mainstream Zionism (of which the Haganah was part) that does not mention war or battle,


> The area that Peel proposed assigning to a Jewish state was substantially smaller than what the Zionist movement had had reason to expect. While Balfour had not defined what was meant by “Palestine,” the Peel Commission itself acknowledged that “the field in which the Jewish national home was to be established was understood at the time of the Balfour Declaration to be the whole of historic Palestine.”10 That area included today’s Gaza, Israel, the West Bank, and all of what is now Jordan. Peel was proposing a Jewish state on a small fraction of that land; 20 percent was allocated to the Jews, while some 70 to 75 percent was allocated to the Arabs.


> While the Jewish community accepted the Peel recommendations, the Arabs rejected them outright. King Abdullah of Transjordan apparently favored the plan, since it would reunite Arabs in Palestine with his kingdom and allocate to it more arable land. The rank and file Arab population was inexorably opposed, however, and Abdullah understood that he could not ignore them. Haj Amin al-Husseini, the mufti of Jerusalem (eventually a supporter of the Nazis), was also vociferously opposed and ensured that the Arab Higher Committee would reject it.


> FIVE MONTHS LATER, in May 1939, the British issued a White Paper (a generic term for an official government policy document) that accepted most of the demands the Arabs had made in the wake of the 1936 riots. Europe was becoming a death trap for the millions of Jews who lived there, but the British decided nonetheless that Jewish immigration to Palestine would be restricted to seventy-five thousand people over a five-year period; any increase would require Arab consent. The White Paper also included a restriction on the sale of land to Jews in many areas and a ten-year plan in which Palestine would become an independent state with an Arab majority.


> The St. Louis, the Patria, and the Struma brought home a single point with terrible clarity. For Jews who had no place to go, a Jewish state—Herzl’s dream and Balfour’s promise—was more critically necessary than it had ever been before.


> UNSCOP, on the other hand, proposed 55 percent for the Jews and 45 percent for the Arabs. Though much of the land assigned to the Jews was desert, UNSCOP’s plan was still a major step forward for the Jews, and a significant setback for the Arabs.


> Just as had happened after Peel, though, the Jewish Agency accepted UNSCOP’s recommendations, and the Arab Higher Committee rejected them outright.


> Amos Oz, who would become one of Israel’s greatest novelists and was several times considered a contender for the Nobel Prize for Literature, later recalled that night in his autobiographical memoir, A Tale of Love and Darkness.

> The war, which would last until early 1949, had two major phases. In the first phase, from the UN vote in November 1947 until Israel’s declaring independence in May 1948, the Haganah and other Jewish military groups fought marginally organized local Arab fighters and irregular Arab forces from other countries who attacked the Yishuv. In many ways, it resembled a civil war between Jews and Arabs more than a conflict between two standing armies. In the second phase of the war, which began in May 1948 and ended in early 1949, Israel—now a country with an official army—would find its forces pitted against the armies of five different countries—Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Jordan, and Egypt.


> Jacobson later reported that neither man said anything for what seemed “like centuries.” Then, though, Truman turned to Jacobson and said, “You win, you baldheaded son-of-a-bitch. I will see him.” It worked. Weizmann, whom Truman had met earlier and described as “a wonderful man, one of the wisest people I think I ever met,” convinced Truman.

Truman sounds like a guy who knew what the right thing was but thought he couldn’t do it for whatever reason. If he truly felt he was in the right, he could have just explained himself instead of avoiding the issue.


> But had there been genocide or rape? Later scholars, both Israeli and Palestinian, agreed that there had been no rapes whatsoever, and that the death toll was almost precisely what the Irgun had claimed.38 Both the Haganah and the Arabs had inflated the numbers. There was a heavy battle, to be sure, with heavy losses. Yet killing civilians had never been the intent. But that was never how the Arabs described it. At the time, their assertions of a horrific massacre spread and prompted more Arabs to flee their homes in Palestine, ultimately making them refugees. To this day, they use Deir Yassin as part of their claim that Israel was “born in sin.”


> Israel’s Declaration of Independence is not a theological document, but a historical one. Unlike the American Declaration of Independence, which speaks both of “God” and of the “Creator,” the Israeli declaration makes no mention of God.


> To pacify the religious elements who hoped for a more overtly religious text, the declaration does say, “Placing our trust in the Rock of Israel, we affix our signatures to this proclamation at this session of the Provisional Council of state,” but that was an intentionally ambiguous phrasing. To the religious, “Rock of Israel” was a traditional phrase that always meant God.8 (Rabbi Maimon made the reference explicit when above his signature he added three Hebrew letters, an acronym meaning “by the grace of God.”9) To the secularists, statehood had nothing to do with God; the Rock of Israel was therefore Jewish history, Jewish grit, or the newfound ability of the Jews to defend themselves.*


> In still other cases, Israel pushed Arabs out. Even Benny Morris understands that Ben-Gurion really had no choice. Ben-Gurion’s responsibility was to create a viable Jewish state. And, says Morris, Ben-Gurion “understood the demographic issue and the need to establish a Jewish state without a large Arab minority.”46 Nothing else would have been viable.

If that's true, why did the Israeli's try to accept the peace agreement from before?


> On September 17, 1948, four Lechi members, taking the matter into their own hands, donned IDF uniforms and assassinated Bernadotte, with the yet-unpublished draft of his plan in hand, in west Jerusalem.


> A year later, on July 5, 1950, the Knesset enacted one of the most symbolic laws Israel would ever pass. It created the Law of Return, giving every Jew the right to immigrate to Israel. Another law then granted these immigrants full citizenship immediately upon arrival. “Home is the place where, when you have to go there, they have to take you in,” Robert Frost wrote in his poem “The Death of the Hired Man,”11 and for the Jewish people, the Jewish state was now that home. No longer would there be thousands of Jews in displaced persons camps in Europe with no one willing to take them in. Never again would ships loaded with Jews desperately seeking a place to live traverse the oceans. With the Law of Return, the era of the homeless, wandering Jew came to an end.


> The Law of Return was also a symbolic overturning of the Nazis’ Nuremberg Laws; the Nazis had defined as Jewish anyone with at least one Jewish grandparent, and the Law of Return used the same definition.* “If you were Jewish enough for the Nazis to seek to kill you,” the Knesset essentially said, “you are Jewish enough to be taken in and protected by the State of Israel.”


> AFTER THE WAR OF INDEPENDENCE, the Arab population of Israel numbered 156,000, about 20 percent of the country’s total population.


> As Israel became more secure and less worried about an internal fifth column, many Israeli leaders—including Menachem Begin, whom Ben-Gurion was still portraying as a fascist—insisted that given Israel’s commitment to democracy, the time had come to end the military administration that then governed Israel’s Arabs. Years later, in 1966, under Levi Eshkol’s much softer premiership, Israel abolished the system.*


> David Ben-Gurion, not only its first prime minister,


> One of the kibbutzim that was the target of repeated such incursions was Nachal Oz, on the Gaza border. On April 29, 1956, twenty-one-year-old Roi Rotberg was patrolling the fields of Nachal Oz, where he lived, on horseback. Accustomed to seeing Gazans illegally picking the kibbutz’s fields, when Rotberg saw a group of Arabs in the fields, he rode toward them to get them to leave. But it was a trap, and as Rotberg approached the “farmers,” a group of fedayeen suddenly appeared, shot and killed Rotberg, then dragged his body into Gaza, where it was horrifically mutilated. Coincidentally, Dayan had met Rotberg a few days earlier. He attended the funeral and delivered a brief eulogy (merely 238 words in total) that became Dayan’s—and then, many Israelis’—classic statement about the inevitability of a long and costly conflict between Israel and its neighbors. Dayan reminded his listeners that there was nothing surprising about Arab resentment and violence. “Let us not hurl blame at the murderers,” he said. “Why should we complain of their hatred for us? Eight years have they sat in the refugee camps of Gaza, and seen, with their own eyes, how we have made a homeland of the soil and the villages where they and their forebears once dwelt.”


> Israel played a unique role in Nasser’s worldview and plan. In one sense, Nasser saw Israel and the Israelis as the region’s latest manifestation of colonialism. At the same time, though, Israel served a positive purpose, for it was the enemy around whose destruction the entire Arab world could unite. “Arab unity,” Nasser exhorted, was the “prerequisite to successful revenge.”


> News of the curfew was publicized just minutes shy of five o’clock, and most of the laborers did not receive the notice in time. Most workers who encountered army units after the curfew were allowed to pass without incident. But when one group of fifty laborers from Kafr Kassem, returning home after work beyond the five P.M. newly imposed curfew, encountered an IDF patrol, the Israeli soldiers shot and killed forty-seven people from the town—including many women and children. It was the largest massacre of Arabs since the founding of the state. Though several officers were arrested and later convicted, all were released from jail shortly thereafter. Ben-Gurion called the incident a “dreadful atrocity,”24 and in years to come, numerous Israeli officials expressed profound remorse for the massacre. In October 2006, Israel’s minister of education, Yuli Tamir, instructed Israeli schools to commemorate the Kafr Kassem massacre and to reflect upon the need to disobey patently immoral orders. In December 2007, Israel’s president, Shimon Peres, attended a reception in Kafr Kassem during the Muslim festival of Eid al-Adha, and asked for the community’s forgiveness. “A terrible event happened here in the past, and we are deeply sorry for it,” he said. In October 2014, Reuven Rivlin, Israel’s tenth president, became the first to attend the annual memorial ceremony at Kafr Kassem.


> When the United Nations had been discussing Israel’s proposed borders prior to partition, the U.S. State Department encouraged the UN to redraw the borders and give more land to the Arabs.


> THE COURT SENTENCED EICHMANN to death.


> In what was a clear act of belligerency, Nasser instructed U Thant to remove the UN troops from the region. Israel assumed that the secretary-general would put up at least some pro forma resistance. But U Thant complied immediately, without so much as informing the General Assembly. By May 19, there was no UN presence in the area. The United Nations, it was painfully clear, was not going to offer Israel protection against an onslaught.


> On May 26, Nasser announced, “Our basic objective will be to destroy Israel.”23 Ahmed Shukeiri, who had been the Saudi ambassador to the United Nations from 1957 to 1962 and who would eventually become the Palestine Liberation Organization’s chairman, declared, “In the event of a conflagration, no Jews whatsoever will survive.”24 Protests were held in Cairo, Baghdad, and Damascus, and throngs of people gathered in the streets, chanting, “Death to the Jews!” and “Throw the Jews into the sea!”


> Michael Oren did in his magisterial Six Days of War,


> The UN’s assault on Israel continued. In November 1975, the General Assembly approved—by a vote of 72 to 35 (with 32 abstentions)—Resolution 3379, which stated that “Zionism is a form of racism and racial discrimination.”


> Israel now had a policy known as the “Begin Doctrine,” which would endure long after Begin himself was gone from the political arena. It held that Israel would not countenance any of its mortal enemies seeking to develop or acquire a weapon of mass destruction.


> The accords, which outlined an arrangement that was intended to last for up to five years while a permanent settlement between the Israelis and Palestinians was negotiated, provided for the creation of a Palestinian Authority, which would administer the territory under Palestinian control. Israeli forces, in turn, would pull back from portions of Gaza and the West Bank.


> Less than two weeks after the September 30 al-Dura incident, two Israeli reservist soldiers, called up for duty to serve as drivers, took a wrong turn on their way to the location at which they were to serve. Surrounded by a crowd in the Palestinian city of Ramallah, they were lynched and murdered. The image of one of the terrorists standing at a window and raising his blood-soaked hands before a cheering crowd made its way around the world; the images repulsed Israelis who felt, once again, that the Palestinians were far more interested in killing Jews than they were in creating a state of their own.*


> Abbas, born in Safed in 1935, had fled during the 1948 war. He was later educated in Cairo and then in Moscow, where he wrote a doctoral dissertation entitled “The Other Side: The Secret Relationship Between Nazism and Zionism,” in which he argued that Zionists had dramatically exaggerated the number of deaths of Jews at the hands of the Nazis. The notion that six million Jews had been killed, he insisted, was a “fantastic lie.”22 Abbas, one of the founding members of Fatah in 1959, had also been one of the Palestinian negotiators of the 1993 Oslo Accords.


> Between 2003 and 2012, the UN issued 314 resolutions concerning Israel, nearly 40 percent of all resolutions passed in that time. That constituted six times more resolutions than those addressing any other country; the “runner-up” was Sudan.


> At the end of 2013, Israeli deputy foreign minister Ze’ev Elkin pointed out that of the 103 resolutions about individual countries from the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC), 43 of them (42 percent) had condemned Israel.


> During the UNHRC’s 2013 March session alone, six resolutions were adopted criticizing Israel, while only four addressed all the remaining countries of the world combined.
