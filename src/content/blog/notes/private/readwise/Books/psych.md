> Linguistic symbols parse the world into discrete categories. hence, they allow us to refer to precise numbers and to separate them categorically from their closest neighbors. Without symbols, we might not discriminate 8 from 9.

This reminds me of Range and the discussion of the villagers who didn't understand certain concepts.


> You can put someone in a brain scanner, for instance, and tell from the parts of the brain that are active whether they are thinking about their favorite song or the layout of their apartment.

Are the neuron patterns really that specific? Are they stamped in that throughly? That reminds of a record, for some reason.


> As Descartes pointed out, I might question almost everything, but my conscious experience is beyond doubt. I am more confident that I am experiencing, right now, a twinge in my neck than I am about anything else in the world.

But you can be fooled into think you have a body. So really all you can know for sure is that you have a brain that is experiencing the sensation of a twinge in your neck.


> As the philosopher Jeremy Bentham put it, when it comes to moral issues, the relevant question isn’t whether something can reason or speak; it is whether it can suffer. And suffering requires consciousness.


> The immediate problem that arises with trying to understand consciousness is that it appears to be a fundamentally first-person event. While I am sure that I am an experiencing being, the internal life of other people is more in doubt.

This has to be a paradox.


> Perhaps there’s a period in the life of every reflective person when they start to worry about this, when they get a little bit solipsistic. They wonder if they are surrounded by empty suits, creatures that go "ooh" and "aah" and smile and scream and sob, but really don't have any experiences. My virtual AI assistant—my Alexa—has thanked me, told me she’s sorry, and said she wants to help me, but I’d be a fool to believe her. She isn’t thankful, is not sorry, and doesn’t want anything. Perhaps other people are like that too, only they put on more of a show.

Reminds me of Michael and the 52hz whale.


> That looks plenty smart, and since slime molds are not conscious (as far as we know), this suggests that you can have intelligence without consciousness. And so why worry about consciousness if we’re interested in how humans come to do intelligent things?

But by that definition, can you just call any process intelligent? Like the formation of mountains?
So isn't the definition too broad?


> There is no more miserable human being than one in whom nothing is habitual but indecision, and for whom the lighting of every cigar, the drinking of every cup, the time of rising and going to bed every day, and the beginning of every bit of work, are subjects of express volitional deliberation.
>  - William James


> The spotlight effect arises from the first-person nature of consciousness. Gilovich and colleagues quote David Foster Wallace here: “There is no experience you’ve had that you were not at the absolute center of.” I’m very conscious of my own appearance, so I assume that others are too, but I don’t realize that, like me, they’re conscious of their appearance.

Feels a little like theory of mind. We don’t understand that other people aren’t thinking about us as much as we are thinking about us.


> It’s a nice analogy: No evolutionary biologist believes that an animal has a single mutation that leads to a fully functioning eye that gives it a reproductive edge over other animals. Rather, animals evolve some limited sensitivity to light, giving them a small reproductive advantage. Then, over the course of generations, this feature of the animal gets increasingly complex; differential reproductive success guides the organism on the path from no eye to a complete eye. Similarly, no behaviorist thinks that a pig just starts to dance. Rather, the environment (the trainer) rewards approximations to dancing, and the behavior becomes increasingly complex over time, going from no dancing to a foxtrot.


> The opposing view is nativism, which proposes that much of our knowledge and capacities are part of our natural endowment.

Obviously, both this and empiricism are correct. Dont ask whether traits are inborn. Ask which.


> Piaget proposed that mental life includes complex cognitive structures, which he called schemas, and he posited two psychological mechanisms that lead to the transformation of these schemas and the creation of new ones. The first, assimilation, is the process of using already-existing schemas to deal with new situations. Take a baby who has a simple schema—it knows how to suck on its mother’s breast. Assimilation is when the baby sucks on a rattle or sucks on its own toes. But to do so successfully, the baby must modify the behavior in certain ways, and this is accommodation, a process through which existing schemas are changed or new schemas are created to fit the new information and new experience.


> One of these is what Piaget called egocentrism. He didn’t mean this in the same way I do when I say that one of my colleagues is egocentric because he spends all his time boasting about his accomplishments and never notices when I get a new haircut. Piaget meant that children literally can’t understand that the world is seen and understood differently by others; they can’t take other people’s perspectives.


> A third limitation we find in the preoperational stage is a failure to distinguish appearance from reality—to appreciate that something might appear to be one thing but be another. As I am writing this, there is a popular set of videos where an object looks like a book or a shoe or a laptop, and then a knife descends, cuts into the object, and, wow, it’s cake! This is funny, but if Piaget is right, children should be befuddled: If it looks like a book, it’s a book.

Is this related to my ideas about kids and their inability to distinguish reality of fiction? Like with the T-rex?
