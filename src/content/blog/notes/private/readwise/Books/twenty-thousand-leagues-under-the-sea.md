> On the 20th of July, 1866, the steamer Governor Higginson, of the
>  Calcutta and Burnach Steam Navigation Company, had met this moving mass five
>  miles off the east coast of Australia. Captain Baker thought at first that he
>  was in the presence of an unknown sandbank; he even prepared to determine its
>  exact position, when two columns of water, projected by the inexplicable
>  object, shot with a hissing noise a hundred and fifty feet up into the air.
>  Now, unless the sandbank had been submitted to the intermittent eruption of a
>  geyser, the Governor Higginson had to do neither more nor less than with
>  an aquatic mammal, unknown till then, which threw up from its blow-holes
>  columns of water mixed with air and vapour.


> On the 5th of March, 1867, the Moravian, of the Montreal Ocean Company,
>  finding herself during the night in 27° 30′ lat. and 72° 15′
>  long., struck on her starboard quarter a rock, marked in no chart for that part
>  of the sea. Under the combined efforts of the wind and its four hundred
>  horse-power, it was going at the rate of thirteen knots. Had it not been for
>  the superior strength of the hull of the Moravian, she would have been
>  broken by the shock and gone down with the 237 passengers she was bringing home
>  from Canada.

Probably begin with a series of these incidents + various reactions to them.
