> There are two editions of the Talmud, one set down in final form by the Rabbis in Palestine about the year 400, a second by the Rabbis in Babylon about a century later. They came to be called respectively the Yerushalmi (after Jerusalem) and the Bavli (Hebrew for Babylonia). The Babylonian is the more extensive and came to be considered authoritative (i.e, if you hear that someone is studying the Talmud, he or she is almost certainly studying the Babylonian).


> Most important is the Mishna, which Rabbi Judah the Prince edited into its current form around the year 200 of the Common Era. The Mishna classifies Jewish law into sixty-three discrete, short books.


> Jewish Wisdom also cites the medieval “codes,” particularly the Mishneh Torah, Maimonides’s twelfth-century, all-encompassing, fourteen-volume summary and codification of Jewish law. Probably the most influential Jewish book issued since the Talmud, this work strongly influenced Rabbi Joseph Karo’s great sixteenth-century code of Jewish law, the Shulkhan Arukh, a knowledge of which is required for those seeking rabbinical ordination.


> Note that the first question asked in heaven is not “Did you believe in God?” or “Did you observe all the rituals?” but “Were you honest in business?” Unfortunately, despite many texts that insist on the primacy of ethics, most Jews associate being religious solely with observing rituals. Throughout the Jewish community, when one asks, “Is so-and-so a religious Jew?” the response invariably is based on the person’s observance of ritual laws: “He (or she) keeps kosher, and observes the Sabbath; he is religious” or “She does not keep kosher or observe the Sabbath; she is not religious.”
>  From such responses, one could easily conclude that Judaism regards ethical behavior as an “extracurricular activity,” something desirable but not essential. The above passage unequivocally asserts that ethics is at Judaism’s core; God’s first concern is with a person’s decency.


> In a frequently quoted passage in the Ethics of the Fathers (2:21), Rabbi Tarfon teaches: “It is not your obligation to complete the task [of perfecting the world], but neither are you free to desist [from doing all you can].”


> It happened that a certain heathen came before Shammai [he and Hillel] were the two leading rabbis of their age] and said to him, “Convert me to Judaism on condition that you teach me the whole Torah while I stand on one foot.” Shammai chased him away with the builder’s rod in his hand. When he came before Hillel, Hillel converted him and said, “What is hateful to you, do not do to your neighbor: this is the whole Torah. The rest is commentary; now go and study.”
>  —Babylonian Talmud, Shabbat 31a (shortly before the beginning of the Common Era)


> The Torah’s central message is the belief in one universal and moral God. Idolatry, with its insistence on a multitude of gods and its denial of a universal morality, negates Judaism’s essence.

I thought it was more about how you shouldn’t prize material wealth above spiritual and ethical wealth.


> There are eight degrees of charity, each one higher than the next. The highest degree, exceeded by none, is that of the person who assists a poor Jew by providing him with a gift or a loan, or by entering into a partnership with him, or helping him find work; in a word, by putting him where he can dispense with other people’s aid.
>  —Moses Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, “Laws Concerning Gifts to the Poor,” 10:7


> According to Jewish law, the highest form of charity is to ensure that a person not need it, at least not for more than a short period.


> [Concerning the words “and his hand falls,” a rabbinic commentary teaches that one must not allow him to fall into utter poverty]: This injunction may be explained with an analogy to a heavy load on a donkey: as long as the donkey is still standing up, one person may take hold of him and lead him [and keep him standing upright]. But once he has fallen, five men cannot raise him up again.
>  —Sifra Leviticus on 25:35–38


> Jews are forbidden to collect any interest on a loan extended to a person to purchase necessities. Throughout history, Jewish communities have established “Free-Loan Societies” (known in Hebrew as Gemakh) to extend interest-free loans to the poor, and to those trying to avoid going on welfare.


> According to Maimonides, anonymous giving (wherein the donor and the recipient do not know each other, i.e., a third party or charitable organization is involved) ranks as the second-highest form of charity.


> On the issue of beggars, I confess to not knowing what is ethically correct. Most charitable organizations and social workers who have commented on this issue argue that giving to beggars is ultimately bad both for them and for the agencies which, ultimately, are the only places that can consistently help these people.


> If a person closes his eyes to avoid giving [any] charity, it is as if he committed idolatry.
>  —Babylonian Talmud, Ketubot 68a
>  This seemingly farfetched connection between stinginess and idolatry is explained by a contemporary Talmud scholar, Rabbi Adin Steinsalz: “A person who knows that his money comes from God will give from his money to the poor. One who doesn’t give to the poor, however, apparently believes that his own strength [and wisdom] are solely responsible for all he has. This is a form of idolatry, insofar as he posits himself as the exclusive source of everything” (Commentary on Ketubot, page 302; Hebrew edition of Steinsalz Talmud).


> Rabbi Chaim of Sanz (d. 1786) said: “The merit of charity is so great that I am happy to give to 100 beggars even if only one might actually be needy. Some people, however, act as if they are exempt from giving charity to 100 beggars in the event that one might be a fraud.”


> The Babylonian Talmud also teaches (Bava Bathra 9a) that while one need not give a beggar a large sum, one should try to give at least a little. Maimonides rules that if one gives nothing at all, one should at least extend a pleasant greeting.


> A beggar once came to the city of Kovno and collected a large sum of money from the residents. The people of the town soon found out that he was an imposter; he really was a wealthy man. The city council wanted to make an ordinance prohibiting beggars from coming to Kovno to collect money. When Rabbi Yitzchak Elchanan Specter (1817–1896), the rabbi of Kovno, heard about the proposed ordinance, he came before the council and requested permission to speak…. “Who deceived you,” he asked, “a needy person or a wealthy person? It was a wealthy person feigning poverty. If you want to make an ordinance, it should be to ban wealthy persons, not needy beggars, from collecting alms.”
>  —Irving Bunim, Ethics from Sinai, Vol. 3, page 121


> A man should meditate on the fact that life is like a revolving wheel, and in the end he, or his children or his grandchildren, may be reduced to taking charity. He should not think, therefore, “How can I diminish my wealth by giving it to the poor?” Instead he should realize that his property is not his own, but only deposited with him as a trust to do with as the Depositor [God] wishes.
>  —Abridged Code of Jewish Law, by Rabbi Solomon Ganzfried (1804–1886), 34:1


> Gemilut Chesed (loving-kindness)


> A person should be more concerned with spiritual than with material matters, but another person’s material welfare is his own spiritual concern.
>  —Rabbi Israel Salanter (1810–1883), founder of the Mussar movement, a movement that put particular emphasis on ethical self-improvement
>  The Russian religious existentialist Nikolai Berdyaev (1874–1948) expressed the same thought more poetically: “The question of bread for myself is a material question, but the question of bread for my neighbor is a spiritual question.”


> German-Jewish philosopher Hermann Cohen (1842–1918) believed that the biblical commandments protecting the stranger represented the beginning of true religion: “The stranger was to be protected, although he was not a member of one’s family, clan, religion, community, or people; simply because he was a human being. In the stranger, therefore, man discovered the idea of humanity” (cited in Richard Schwartz, Judaism and Global Survival, page 13).


> “Where,” Rabbi Joshua asked, “shall I find the Messiah?”
>  “At the gate of the city,” Elijah replied.
>  “How shall I recognize him?”
>  “He sits among the lepers.”
>  “Among the lepers?” cried Rabbi Joshua. “What is he doing there?”
>  “He changes their bandages,” Elijah answered. “He changes them one by one.”
>  That may not seem like much for a Messiah to be doing. But, apparently, in the eyes of God, it is a mighty thing indeed.
>  —Rabbi Robert Kirschner, sermon on AIDS, quoted in Albert Vorspan and David Saperstein, Tough Choices: Jewish Perspectives on Social Justice, pages 236–237


> Harvard law professor Mary Ann Glendon notes that “generations of first-year law students have been introduced to basic elements of the law through one or another variant of the following hypothetical case: An Olympic swimmer out for a stroll walks by a swimming pool and sees an adorable toddler drowning in the shallow end. He could easily save her with no risk to himself, but instead he pulls up a chair and looks on as she perishes.” Glendon writes that the object of this exercise is to prove to future lawyers that the athlete has violated no law, that indeed “there is no peg in our legal system on which to hang a duty to rescue another person in danger.”


> (The story of the Allies’ indifference is told in two important historical works: David Wyman, The Abandonment of the Jews: America and the Holocaust 1941–1945, and Martin Gilbert, Auschwitz and the Allies.)


> They asked [Hasidic Rebbe Ya’akov Yitzhak, known as] the “holy Yehudi”:
>  “Why is it written, ‘Justice, justice you shall pursue?’ Why is the word ‘justice’ repeated?”
>  He answered: “We ought to follow justice with justice, and not with unrighteousness.” That means: The use of unrighteousness as a means to a righteous end makes the end itself unrighteous.
>  —Hasidic Rebbe Ya’akov Yitzhak of Pzhysha (1766–1814), quoted in Martin Buber, ed., Ten Rungs: Hasidic Sayings, page 7


> It is no exaggeration to claim that the rest of the Bible is a resoundingly affirmative response to Cain’s query:
>  9. Am I my brother’s keeper?
>  —Genesis 4:9


> Because the act is irrevocable, defrauding the public becomes, like murder and slander, something of an unforgivable sin.


> Stealing from a non-Jew is worse than stealing from a Jew because of the profanation of God’s name.
>  —Tosefta, Bava Kamma 10:15
>  Thus, a Jew who steals from another Jew violates the biblical law against stealing, but that is his or her only offense. However, when a Jew steals from a non-Jew, he also brings Judaism and the Jewish people into disrepute, so that his sin is more severe.
