> TA-NAKH — rhymes with BACH —IS AN ACRONYM FOR THE THREE categories of books that make up the Hebrew Bible: Torah, Nevi’im (Prophets), and Ketuvim (Writings).


> In Hebrew the five books are also called Chumash, from the Hebrew word chamesh (five).


> According to Jewish tradition, the books were dictated to Moses by God sometime around 1220 B.C.E., shortly after the Exodus from Egypt.


> the first book of the Torah is called Genesis in English, because its opening chapters tell the story of the creation of the world. In this one instance, the Hebrew name is very similar, since the Torah’s opening word, Brei’sheet, means “In the beginning.”


> In Hebrew, the Torah’s second book is called Sh’mot, or Names, because its opening verse reads “Ay-leh shemot b’nai yisrael—And these are the names of the children of Israel.”


> In English the primary meaning of “prophet” is one who predicts the future; however, the corresponding Hebrew word, navi, means “spokesman for God.”


> the Jews have been chosen by God to spread His message to the world—


> God puts Adam into a deep sleep, takes a rib (actually, the Hebrew text is not really clear what it was)


> After a slight hesitation, Eve eats of the tree’s fruit—there is no reason, by the way, to suppose that the fruit she eats is an apple—


> Eve ate from the tree.” In Christian theology this story of disobedience became the Original Sin with which all of mankind was permanently stained. But Jews have never regarded it with the same seriousness. It was an act of defiance, to be sure, and because it transgressed God’s command, it was a sin. But the idea that every child is born damned for that sin is alien to Jewish thought.


> Am I my brother’s keeper?” In essence, the entire Bible is written as an affirmative response to this question. “What have you done?” God rails at Cain. “Your brother’s blood cries out to me from the earth.” The Hebrew word used, d’mei, actually is the plural of the Hebrew word for blood, literally meaning “bloods”—“your brother’s bloods cry out to me from the earth” —which the rabbis understood to mean “his blood and the blood of his unborn descendants” (Mishna Sanhedrin 4:5). From this perspective, most killers are mass murderers, since they bear responsibility not only for the victim, but also for his or her unborn descendants, whose lives they have also destroyed.


> AS NOTED IN THE P REVIOUS ENTRY, THE TORAH H AS A R ATHER SOMBER view of human nature. “The tendency of man’s heart is toward evil from his youth,” God says in Genesis 8:21 (a similar sentiment is echoed in 6:5). This early assessment of human nature has nothing to do with the previously discussed Christian concept of Original Sin (see Adam and Eve). Rather, Genesis is suggesting that evil and selfishness are more natural to man than goodness and altruism. Children are born selfish and have to be educated to altruism. As my friend Dennis Prager once pointed out: “When was the last time you heard a mother yelling at her three-year-old son: ‘Johnny, stop being so selfless and giving all your toys away to the other children in the neighborhood’”?


> The willingness to confront the Almighty stems from the belief that God, like man, has responsibilities, and deserves criticism when He fails to fulfill them.


> While today we regard child sacrifice as grossly immoral, it is largely because the Bible outlawed it, not because it is self-evident. For thousands of years, human beings have been sacrificed in diverse societies throughout the world, usually to win the favor of the gods and/or to guarantee bountiful crops. Hundreds of years after Abraham, the king of Moab, desperate to forestall an Israelite victory, “took his first-born son, who was to succeed him as king, and offered him up … as a burnt offering” (II Kings 3:27). When God demanded that Abraham sacrifice Isaac, the *Patriarch probably was more distressed than surprised, for he had no way of knowing then that human beings were not to sacrifice their children; certainly, he had heard of his neighbors doing so. What is new in “the binding of Isaac” story, therefore, is not God’s initial request but his final statement, that He doesn’t want human sacrifices. Thus, Abraham is to be praised for not withholding from God what was most valuable to him but, as the text makes very clear, he is not to be emulated.


> Shortly thereafter, Moses ascends Mount Sinai for forty days and nights. Many Jews are under the impression that Jewish tradition claims that at Sinai, God gives Moses the entire Torah. My friend Dennis Prager has noted that this is logically impossible.

Is it a little silly to talk about logic regarding a supernatural story?


> According to the rabbis of the Talmud, the Torah itself is given scroll by scroll by God to Moses during the Israelites’ sojourn in the desert.


> the ceremony of circumcision is known in Hebrew as *brit milah, the covenant of * circumcision, in line with God’s command to Abraham: “…


> The covenant is understood as a two-way relationship: The Jews are to keep God’s laws, and He is to watch over them.


> The correct translation of Lo tirtzakh is “You shall not murder.”


> However, the Hebrew, Lo tissa, literally means “You shall not carry [God’s name in vain]”; in other words, don’t use God as your justification in selfish causes.


> TO THIS DAY, MOST JEWS WHOSE LAST NAMES ARE COHEN OR KATZ, and all other Jews who know themselves to be Kohanim/Priests (see next entry), trace their descent back to the first Jewish High Priest, Aaron.


> The most famous sacrifice was the one offered on *Passover, and known as the Paschal lamb.


> From the time when King *Solomon built the First Temple in Jerusalem about 950 B.C.E., Jewish law stated that sacrifices were to be offered there only. A subgroup within the tribe of Levi, known as *Kohanim (Priests), were responsible for offering the sacrifices.


> One kind of sacrifice, however, involved the animal being wholly burned, and came to be known in English as a holocaust.


> When the Second Temple was destroyed in 70 C.E., many Jews despaired of ever gaining forgiveness for their sins; there was now no place, after all, where they could offer sacrifices. The great first-century rabbi *Yochanan ben Zakkai revolutionized Jewish thinking with his pronouncement that acts of *loving-kindness now superseded sacrifices as the preferred way of attaining God’s forgiveness. In addition to deeds of loving-kindness, the Talmud later taught that “studying of Torah is a greater act than bringing daily sacrifices” (Megillah 3b). Indeed, from the Jewish perspective, the Christian emphasis on the atoning sacrifice and atoning blood of Jesus is regarded as a type of throwback to human sacrifice.


> The reason the Temple cannot be built is that centuries ago Muslims built two mosques on the site of the Beit ha-Mikdash.


> Psychologists often have noted that people who don’t like themselves usually have even greater difficulty liking and being good to others. It is hard to imagine, for example, an abusive parent who has a decent self-image.

I didn’t like myself for a long time, and I’ve definitely been mean. Been nice, too. So it’s not one or the other. But it’s certainly true that it’s easier to be pleasant when you like yourself, because life is more pleasant when you like yourself.


> The last words in the verse, “I am the Lord,” usually are passed over as irrelevant to the commandment. In Jewish thought, however, the rationale for loving our neighbors is precisely because God, who created all of us in His image, demands it. Judaism sees ethics as ultimately dependent on a source above humans, on God. Without God, morality is reduced to a matter of opinion. As Ivan Karamazov mournfully declares in Dostoevski’s The Brothers Karamazov, “If there is no God, then everything is permitted.”

I have trouble with this. Isn’t the commandment to love your neighbor as yourself enough? Why does it have to be commanded by God in order to take it seriously?
