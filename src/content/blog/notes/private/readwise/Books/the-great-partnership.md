> When a society loses its religion it tends not to last very long thereafter. It discovers that having severed the ropes that moor its morality to something transcendent, all it has left is relativism, and relativism is incapable of defending anything, including itself. When a society loses its soul, it is about to lose its future. So let us move on.


> The creative tension between the two is what keeps us sane, grounded in physical reality without losing our spiritual sensibility. It keeps us human and humane.

This may be similar to the symmetries of the universe, are fundamental tensions that hold each other up.


> The other is the ability to join things together so that they tell a story, and to join people together so that they form relationships. The best example of the first is science, of the second, religion.

People love to hate religion because they think it inspires violence. but groups of people united is what inspires the violence. when people start thinking of themselves as us, and them as them. 
so is the violence of religion a byproduct of its effectiveness in joining people together? but that doesnt give credit to the ideas of the relgion, which may be violent in nature.


> Science takes things apart to see how they work. Religion puts things together to see what they mean.

understanding and meaning


> Science is about explanation. Religion is about meaning.

together, they equal understanding


> Science sees the underlying order of the physical world. Religion hears the music beneath the noise.


> Like all else that lives, we have desires. Unlike anything else that lives, we can pass judgement on those desires and decide not to pursue them. We are free.


> What made Abrahamic monotheism unique is that it endowed life with meaning. That is a point rarely and barely understood, but it is the quintessential argument of this book. We make a great mistake if we think of monotheism as a linear development from polytheism, as if people first worshipped many gods, then reduced them to one. Monotheism is something else entirely. The meaning of a system lies outside the system. Therefore the meaning of the universe lies outside the universe. Monotheism, by discovering the transcendental God, the God who stands outside the universe and creates it, made it possible for the first time to believe that life has a meaning, not just a mythic or scientific explanation.

This is clearly an important point, but I don’t understand it.


> most of us have experienced hope. But a culture that sees the universe as blind and indifferent to humanity generates a literature of tragedy, and a culture that believes in a God of love, forgiveness and redemption produces a literature of hope. There was no Sophocles in ancient Israel. There was no Isaiah in ancient Greece.

He saying there’s no hope without God basically but that does not cohere with my personal experience.


> A great Jewish mystic, the Baal Shem Tov, compared such atheists to a deaf man who for the first time comes on a violinist playing in the town square while the townspeople, moved by the lilt and rhythm of his playing, dance in joy. Unable to hear the music, he concludes that they are all mad.


> People who are confident in their beliefs feel no need to pillory or caricature their opponents.


> Religion is not a horseshoe, and it is not about luck, but one thing many Jews know – and I think Isaiah Berlin was one of them – is that it works whether you believe in it or not. Love, trust, family, community, giving as integral to living, study as a sacred task, argument as a sacred duty, forgiveness, atonement, gratitude, prayer: these things work whether you believe in them or not. The Jewish way is first to live God, then to ask questions about him. Faith begins with the search for meaning, because it is the discovery of meaning that creates human freedom and dignity. Finding God’s freedom, we discover our own.


> The second: The universe was called into being by One outside the universe, fascinated by being, and with that desire-to-bring-things-into-being that we call love.


> The closest the voice ever came to identifying itself was in the cryptic, enigmatic words Ehyeh asher ehyeh, ‘I will be what I will be’.


> ‘Do you not recall the words of Xenophanes, that we make God in our own image? “Man made his gods, and furnished them with his own body, voice and garments.” If a horse could worship, he would make his god a horse. If an ox had a god, it would be an ox.’ ‘You forget,’ says the second, ‘that Xenophanes used this argument to refute polytheism and argue for monotheism. Xenophanes was not an atheist but a believer.’


> The argument is interminable, but though it is usually portrayed as an argument between religion and science, that is not what it is. The science is the same in both stories. The difference lies in how far we are willing to push the question, ‘Why?’ The first story says there is no why. The second says there is. If the universe exists, and there was a time when it did not exist, then someone or something brought it into being, someone whose existence is neither part of nor dependent on the universe.


> If so, why? The most economical hypothesis is that it did so because it willed so. But why would a being independent of the universe wish to bring a universe into being? There is only one compelling answer: out of the selfless desire to make space for otherness that, for want of a better word, we call love.

This is completely arbitrary. I don’t see why it’s not just as likely that a creator would I don’t know create something the same way or or for the same reasons that we might create simulation a video game. So I admire the attempt to make hope intrinsic to existence and I think that’s a noble goal I mean, maybe one of the most noble goals but I don’t think arguing it this way is going to convince anybody.


> The search for God is the search for meaning. The discovery of God is the discovery of meaning. And that is no small thing, for we are meaning-seeking animals. It is what makes us unique. To be human is to ask the question, ‘Why?’

But you didn’t discover God you made it up


> There is an internal logic of the system – the laws of banking, the rules of football – but the meaning of the system lies elsewhere, and it can only be understood through some sense of the wider human context in which it is set. To do this you have to step outside the system and see why it was brought into being. There is no way of understanding the meaning of football by merely knowing its rules. They tell you how to play the game, but not why people do so and why they invest in it the passions they do. The internal workings of a system do not explain the place the system holds in human lives. The meaning of the system lies outside the system. Therefore, the meaning of the universe lies outside the universe. That was the revolution of Abrahamic monotheism.

Is the question here more about whether meeting exists or whether it’s a worthy pursuit. Because meaning doesn’t exist without people I’m pretty sure that’s true. Maybe this book will convince me otherwise but I also believe that it’s a worthy pursuit.


> But they were within the universe, and therefore in principle they could not give meaning to the universe.

I don’t understand this at all because the entire project of religion, which is an advent of people is to give meaning to life people are inside the universe. Therefore, the meaning is coming from inside the universe you cannot prove the insistence of God you made it up, therefore the meaning that you described to God came from you not the other way around because you made God up.


> The same is true for science, whose subject is the interrelationship of things within the natural world. There is a great deal of difference between giving a climatological explanation of rain, and explaining that rain is the work of the Aztec god Tleloc, the Persian god Tishtrya, Taki-Tsu-Hiko in Japan, Imdugud in Assyria, and so on through an impressive cast list of gods and goddesses of inundation. Science is not myth, myth is not science, but they are both explanations of some phenomenon within nature in terms of other phenomena within nature. In this sense, myth is proto-science. Science displaces myth.


> Can we prove life has a meaning? Clearly not. Imagine two people reflecting on the course of their own lives. One looks back and sees a mere series of events, with no connecting thread. The other sees a coherent narrative. Her life has a meaning. It can be told as a story. To be sure, she knows that there were distractions, setbacks, false turns, long periods in which nothing significant happened. But looking back, she can see that she was drawn to a calling, falteringly at first but then with ever-increasing confidence. The two people inhabit the same world, but they live different kinds of lives.

earlier he was talking about how it’s braver to believe in God because it voiced responsibility on you or at least he put that forward as a possibility if he wasn’t necessarily taking that position, but saying God doesn’t tell you what to do he doesn’t give you the responsibility the responsibility. It’s not only your responsibility to fulfill the responsibility, but it’s also your responsibility to decide to fulfill the responsibility that is an men’s pressure and could it be possible that religion is just a way or belief in monotheistic God rather a moralistic who makes ethical demands of you. Is it possible that that is just a way to make that burden more bearable?


> Meaning is always a matter of interpretation.

if meaning is a matter of interpretation then why do we talk about discovering meaning? Because discovery implies that it’s already there if you discover something it was already there but if you interpret something you put it there it wasn’t there before you brought it.


> ‘Why should I not commit suicide?’ It is possible to live without meaning, just as it is possible to live without music, a sense of humour, or the courage to take a risk. But it cannot seriously be argued that the loss of meaning is not a loss.

Brian Green brings us up in one of his books which is kind of interesting and I guess the conclusion I take from that is he gets his meaning from physics and cosmology and that’s why he’s a physicist and a cosmologist and this author Jonathan Sacks you know while acknowledging the truth of science takes his meaning from religion, which is why he’s a rabbi and not a physicist so he argues that he he seems to be arguing that he kind of has the only answer here but I guess I would argue that what gives you meaning varies from person a person it’s not something that’s fixed. I don’t think I think people have to decide what is meaningful to them.
So I think it’s less about telling people what they should find meaningful or where they should find meaning but rather give them the tools to find meaning


> What remained once you had lost everything there was to lose? Frankl realised that there was one freedom that can never be taken away: We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread. They may have been few in number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms – to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.


> To find meaning in life is to find something we are called on to do, something no one else can do.

I would omit the call on part otherwise I think this is a great sentiment


> Frankl’s psychotherapy is part of a wider conception I call the ethics of responsibility.20 The word ‘responsible’ is related to response. It is an answer to a question posed by another. Responsibility is not something that comes from within, but is always a response to something or someone outside us. In The Responsible Self, Richard Niebuhr writes, ‘Responsibility affirms: God is acting in all actions upon you. So respond to all actions as to his action.’21 He adds, ‘We are most aware of our existence in the moment, in the now, when we are radically acted upon by something from without, when we are under the necessity of meeting a challenge with an action of our own, as is the case in every important decision.’22 The responsible life is one that responds. In the theological sense it means that God is the question to which our lives are an answer.


> Frankl rescued lives by helping people find a reason to live, a reason that comes from outside the self. This is, if you like, a secularised version of Abrahamic monotheism, which began with a divine call. Frankl’s faith, which is mine, is that the search for meaning constitutes our humanity.


> Science is the search for explanation. Religion is the search for meaning.


> So a language with vowels, where the words can be understood one by one, can be processed by the left brain. We read these languages from left to right, moving our head to the right, thus engaging the left brain. Languages without vowels make demands on the context-understanding, integrative functions of the right brain, so we read them from right to left, moving our head leftwards and engaging the right brain.

this seems far-fetched is he saying that all languages that lack of vowels are red from right to left or is he saying that we read them from right to left because they lack vowels? Is that a fundamental truth of language is that true? Is he implying that if we didn’t have vowels in English, we would just read it the other way, but then wouldn’t we be saying the words backwards? I don’t really understand what he saying here.


> The first alphabet, known as proto-Sinaitic, and dated to around 1800 BCE, was discovered by the British archaeologist Flinders Petrie in 1905. He found a series of markings carved into sandstone at Serabit el-Khadem in the Sinai desert, the site of what had been turquoise mines during the age of the pharaohs. Flinders Petrie surmised that the writing may have been the work of the Hebrew slaves who worked the mines, or even that they may have made the inscriptions on their way to the Promised Land. He himself, however, was unable to decipher them and failed to recognise that they were in fact alphabetic: that symbols no longer represented objects or syllables but the initial sound of the syllable, so that, for example, the symbol for ‘box’ meant simply the sound ‘b’. Not until 1916 did British Egyptologist Alan Gardiner make that discovery. There was another major find in the 1990s, at Wadi el-Hol, thirty miles north-west of Luxor, by American archaeologist John Darnell. Here too there were inscriptions carved into rock, similar to, though not identical with, those at Serabit, and of roughly the same date or slightly older. The alphabet has the distinction of being invented only once. All others are direct or indirect descendants of that first system, used by the people of what today is the land of Israel: the Hebrews and perhaps other migrant workers, the Canaanites, Phoenicians and so on. The word ‘alphabet’ itself signals this: it derives from the first two letters of the Hebrew script, aleph and bet. The early alphabets, like Hebrew still today, had no letters for vowels. They came to be written from right to left.


> The difference between behaviour and action points to something else besides. The crucial differentiation between humans and all other animals is that we make meanings,


> In her book Poetic Justice, Martha Nussbaum explains why judges should read novels. Only through the exercise of imaginative identification can judges balance the universality of law with a human understanding of this unique individual standing in the dock.


> So remote is the God of pure being – the legacy of Plato and Aristotle – that the distance is bridged in Christianity by a figure that has no counterpart in Judaism, the Son of God, a person who is both human and divine. In Judaism we are all both human and divine, dust of the Earth yet breathing God’s breath and bearing God’s image. These are profoundly different theologies.


> ‘Accept the truth, whoever says it,’ said Maimonides.13 There is religious dignity and integrity to science.


> No less remarkable is the way in which the rabbis of that era recognised that when it came to science, their own views might simply be wrong. There is a talmudic passage – it reads somewhat quaintly nowadays – in which the rabbis are discussing the question of where the sun goes at night. First they give their own opinion, then they cite the Greek view, that of Ptolemy. They then conclude, ‘And their view seems more plausible than ours.’14That is the way the Talmud tells the story. They are right. We are wrong. End of discussion.


> The Hebrew Bible never thought in these terms. The heavens proclaim the glory of God; they do not prove the existence of God. All that breathes praises its Creator; it does not furnish philosophical verification of a Creator. In the Bible, people talk to God, not about God. The Hebrew word da’at, usually translated as ‘knowledge’, does not mean knowledge at all in the Greek sense, as a form of cognition. It means intimacy, relationship, the touch of soul and soul. God, for the Bible, is not to be found in nature for God transcends nature, as do we whenever we exercise our freedom. In Hebrew the word for universe, olam, is semantically related to the word ‘hidden’, ne’elam. God is present in nature but in a hidden way.

I can’t tell if he means this to be taken as proof of God, or as an assertion that proof isn’t necessary, or itherwise that proof isn’t the point.


> Faith is about seeing the miraculous in the everyday, not about waiting every day for the miraculous.


> Yeats put it best: The intellect of man is forced to choose perfection of the life, or of the work, And if it take the second must refuse A heavenly mansion, raging in the dark.


> As Karl Popper said in The Poverty of Historicism, the future cannot be predicted, because how it will happen depends on discoveries that cannot be predicted, because if they could be predicted they would already have been discovered.
