> Sam found lots of trades whose success turned on the idiocy of some other trader or trading algorithm. Asher trades. For a two-week stretch, Canada’s main stock market index behaved weirdly at the opening every morning. At 9:30 it would pop higher or drop lower with unusual violence and then, at 9:31, revert to its previous levels. That wasn’t how a market normally behaved in response to news. Something else was going on. Sam made a study and discovered that a month earlier, someone had done a massive, multibillion-dollar-contract-sized trade in options on the Canadian stock market index. The trader who had done it needed to hedge his position whenever the price of the Canadian index moved. To do this, the trader had created a bot, which mindlessly bought the Canadian index when it went up, and sold the Canadian index when it went down, thus causing it to go either up or down more than it otherwise would have done. On days the Canadian stock market opened at a higher price than the day before, the bot would buy the index, driving its price even higher, requiring the bot to buy even more. It did the same thing in reverse when the index opened at a lower price than the day before. For two weeks Sam’s trading desk made a small fortune simply by selling the Canadian index after the bot had bought it, and buying the Canadian index after the bot had sold it, until the trader who had created the bot wised up and turned it off. “It was essentially reverse engineering someone else’s dumb algo,” said Sam.
