> not necessary to be a “writer” to write well. Clear writing is the logical arrangement of thought;


> we write to find out what we know and what we want to say.


> “writing across the curriculum” wasn’t just a method of getting students to write who were afraid of writing. It was also a method of getting students to learn who were afraid of learning.


> Another reason is that it’s not what most English teachers want to do. Their real subject is literature—not how to write, but how to read: how to extract meaning from a written text. That’s what they were primarily hired to teach and what they were trained to teach. Inevitably, much of the writing that English teachers assign is based on literature—on what somebody else has already written—and therefore has little reality And what students in turn write for the English teacher is more florid than what they would write for anybody else. They reach for a “literary” style that they think the teacher wants and that they assume is “good English.” But this style is no part of who they are. Nor is it necessarily good English; much of what academics write and read is fuzzy and verbose. Students should be learning a strong and unpretentious prose that will carry their thoughts about the world they live in.


> A science-minded student, if he were encouraged to write about a scientific or technological subject, would soon find that he could do it. He would discover that writing is primarily an exercise in logic and that words are just tools designed to do a specific job. Similarly, the sciences could be demystified for liberal arts types like me. We could write our way into at least a partial understanding of many subjects whose language of numbers and symbols has scared us away.


> “Effortless” articles that look as if they were dashed off are the result of strenuous effort. A piece of writing must be viewed as a constantly evolving organism.


> If the process is sound, the product will take care of itself.


> Meanwhile I draw on two sources of energy that I commend to anyone trying to survive in this vulnerable craft: confidence and ego. If you don’t have confidence in what you’re doing you might as well not do it.
