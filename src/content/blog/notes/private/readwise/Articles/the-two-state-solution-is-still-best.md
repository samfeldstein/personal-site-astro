> I think that if you’re a young person who’s on the left because you think climate change is real and abortion rights are important and health care should be a right rather than a privilege, you almost certainly also think that it’s awful to see so many Palestinian civilians dying in Gaza. You probably [“sympathize more”](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/poll-majority-of-americans-sympathize-with-israel-but-growing-number-say-military-response-in-gaza-too-much) (as the pollsters say) with the Palestinians because they are suffering more. And you would like to be pro-Palestinian. If you look around at what your peers are posting, it’s clear that the pro-Palestinian thing you are supposed to say is that Israel is settler-colonialism, similar to Apartheid South Africa, and that system should be destroyed. Realistically, 99.9 percent of people aren’t going to put any more thought into it than “I want to signal solidarity with Palestinian suffering so I’m gonna repost these slogans.”
>  If someone shows up and says “look, guys, if we tell Israel that we want ‘free Palestine from the River to the Sea,’ occupation and war will continue indefinitely, whereas if we tell Israel that we want an independent Palestinian state, we might be able to get it,” that person is going to get yelled at. Idiots on the internet are happy to yell at *Rashida Tlaib* for insufficient anti-Israel posturing, so no normal person is going to stand up for the view that moderation of Palestinian demands is the best way to achieve a better life.


> Here are some true things:
>  • In 1948, when Jews represented about a quarter of the population of Mandate Palestine and Arabs wanted to halt Jewish immigration, an offer was made to give Jews half the land for a Jewish State that could then host more Jewish immigrants. Arabs rejected that as a bad deal, so a war was fought, and the Jews ended up with a larger state than they were offered in partition.
>  • When Arab states controlled the Gaza Strip and the West Bank from 1948-1967, they could have created Palestinian states (though not a unified Palestinian state because that would have required Israeli cooperation) on those territories. But they did not. Instead, Jordan annexed the West Bank, and then later Egypt and Syria and Jordan attacked Israel.
>  The Palestinian predicament really is substantially a result of poor decision-making on the Arab side of the conflict.
