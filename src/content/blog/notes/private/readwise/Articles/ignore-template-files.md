> Add an `.eleventyignore` file to your *input* directory or *project root* directory for a new line-separated list of files (or globs) that will not be processed by Eleventy. Note that any paths listed in your project’s `.gitignore` file are automatically ignored—you don’t need to duplicate them to your `.eleventyignore` file.
