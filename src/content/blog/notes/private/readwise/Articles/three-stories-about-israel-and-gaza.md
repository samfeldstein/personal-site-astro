> I think this obvious and humiliating weakness has been the primary cause of the government’s mindlessly bludgeoning attack on Gaza. Having been revealed as weak and feckless, the government is trying to make everyone forget that through a show of strength.


> All those who want Israel to become the world’s pariah state must be absolutely delighted to see the civilian casualties the Israeli armed forces have inflicted. They now have all the documentary evidence they could desire.


> [*the* explicit purpose of Hamas](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/10/what-hamas-wants-israel/675648/?ref=deep-shtetl) (and not only of Hamas) is first to drive every single Jew out of Palestine — that’s what the phrase “from the river to the sea” means, no matter what Rashida Tlaib says *she* means by it — and then, at the end of history, to murder every Jew in the “final confrontation” between Islam and Judaism. The Israelis don’t really care how many Palestinians and Arabs and Muslims there are in the world as long as Jews find safety; conversely, Hamas (and not only Hamas) sees genocide of the world’s Jews as their *divine mandate*. It’s a distinction — partly though not wholly rooted in the difference between a proselytizing religion and a non-proselytizing one — that no honest observer can deny.


> In the short term my deepest concern is for the suffering of the people of Gaza; in the long term my deepest concern is for the shaky future of the world’s Jews.


> when Israel is involved in any conversation, the simplistic heuristics kick in with a vengeance, leading to a classic availability cascade. The logic works like this: 
>  > X is wrong and bad;  
>  > Israel is X;  
>  > Therefore, Israel is wrong and bad. 
>  Making the relevant adjustments for inflection, all you have to do is replace X with “colonialism” or “settler colonialism” or “apartheid” or “racism” or “ethno-nationalism” and hey presto: done and dusted.


> If Israel is an example of settler colonialism then it’s not like any other example of settler colonialism in the history of the world. I mean: What nation is Israel a colony of? And in what other place do the “settlers” have [a 3000-year history of waxing and waning residence?](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/28/opinion/jewish-history-israel.html)


> Almost everyone is so committed to the comforting simplifications of their heuristics that they prefer ignorance to knowledge that complicates.
