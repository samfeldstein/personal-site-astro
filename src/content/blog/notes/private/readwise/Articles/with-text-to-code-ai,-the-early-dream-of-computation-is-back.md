> In 1983, US courts (ruling in favor of Apple) granted software the legal status of literary works, enabling companies to claim ownership and profit from their creations. That same year, IBM announced that it would no longer distribute source code along with its software—making modifications by the end-user impossible.


> Large language models like ChatGPT are trained using deep learning, a powerful form of machine learning that involves training a network of interconnected neurons to recognize patterns in data. In the case of language models, this means feeding the neurons vast amounts of text data so they can learn the patterns of language. Once trained, the model can use this knowledge to generate human-like text when given a prompt.


> Do what's good for humans, modeled on how humans already do things; ignore what's convenient for computers.
