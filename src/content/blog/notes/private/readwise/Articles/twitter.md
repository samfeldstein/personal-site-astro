Over time, this builds up and can be a powerful creative tool.

> Early on, replying > tweeting, if you want to gain followers and make friends


> **If you want to build a professional following, you can go a long way by building cool stuff and tweeting about it** -- post a demo video or a Github link, talk about the process of building it, etc.
