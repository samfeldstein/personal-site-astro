> To navigate life we create mental models of the world out there, and then we confuse the models for reality. Have you ever noticed this when interacting with someone who has a less accurate model than you: that it’s like they have a VR headset on and are fighting against monsters you know are not there? For instance, there was a Swedish couple who were working at the embassy in New Delhi in the 1990s. They had a housekeeper. On the housekeeper’s birthday, they made her a cake and invited her to eat at their table. She refused. She insisted she had to eat on the floor, or else she’d be reborn as a lower animal. It is tempting to say, “You can take off the headset, there is nothing there. Have some cake.” But we all have headsets on. There is no way of living in direct contact with reality.


> If you can break inaccurate mental models, life becomes easier to navigate. But how do you do that? I know two ways.
>  1. Find people who understand things better than you and read what they have to say. Read with the intention of answering your questions. If you can’t find the answers, email them.
>  2. Perform experiments. By this I don’t mean do random things. I mean, STATE YOUR ASSUMPTIONS and TEST THEM. Most of the time, the slot machine of an experiment yields nothing. But that’s ok. A few will rearrange the world around you.
