> A lot of *Sadly, Porn* feels like a guy trying to cram an antimeme into your head. Psychoanalysis is about defense mechanisms; you actually like Shel Silverstein books because they speak to your secret desire to kill your father and marry your mother (or whatever)

Isn't that just the product of two competing emotions? One part of your brains wants to kill the enemy and take his woman. The other part knows that in this instance, the enemy is your dad and the woman is your mom, and you love these people and don't want to harm them. So isn't the discomfort at this notion just a matter of those two wires crossing? It doesn't say anything about what you "really" want. The fact is, you want both those things. It's not that you want to have sex with your mom. It's just that there's a very powerful part of your brain that wants to have sex with all women, and this part of your brain doesn't know how to tell your mom from any other woman. But that's why the other part of your brain exists. To keep this moron from committing a major goof. You could call these guys Brutus and Pierre.
So the very fact that the idea makes you uncomfortable doesn't mean you "really" want it. It just means Pierre is awake and paying attention, and he's holding up a big sign going, "Uh, no. Brutus. Not that one, please."
Because we're conscious, we're aware of both, and that's awkward.
