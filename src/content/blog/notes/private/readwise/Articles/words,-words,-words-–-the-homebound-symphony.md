> Many of our arguments are fruitless because we don’t know the meaning of the words we use. And we don’t know the meaning of the words we use because _meaning_ is not a property of language that our culture thinks important. In common usage, especially on social media, words are passwords, [shibboleths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibboleth) — they are not employed to convey any substantive meaning but to mark identity. You use the words that people you want to associate yourself with use; it doesn’t go any further than that. If they call Israel an example of “colonialism,” then you will too, regardless of the appropriateness of the word.
