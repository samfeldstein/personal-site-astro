> **Anxiety.** Worrying takes brainpower, which can get in the way of focusing. Signs of a generalized anxiety disorder can include:
>  • Constant anxiety
>  • Fear
>  • Indecisiveness

Definitely indecisive.


> Talk to your doctor if you can’t focus, so much so that it’s affecting your life.

I feel like I’m falling behind in life. I don’t know if that’s related to attention span though. I never could write for more than a couple hours at a time, and even that felt like a tall order.


> **Multitasking.** Working on a report while answering emails and listening to a conference call might seem like a timesaver. But juggling too much at once can backfire. Our brains are wired to handle one thing at a time. Research shows constantly switching gears makes you less efficient and more likely to make mistakes.

Guilty


> **Time block.** Have a lot on your plate? Schedule specific times for each task, such as a half-hour each [morning](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/health-benefits-morning-walk) and afternoon to check email or answer calls. This keeps you from switching back and forth between duties.

Great, I already do this.


> those with a short [attention](https://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd) span frequently have trouble focusing on tasks and conversations.

Definitely me. Especially in conversations, which bothers me!
