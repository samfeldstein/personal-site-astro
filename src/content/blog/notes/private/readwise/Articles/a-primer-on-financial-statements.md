> Operating expenses are expenses that, at least in theory, provide benefits only for the current period;


> Financing expenses are expenses arising from the non-equity financing used to raise capital for the business; the most common example is interest expenses.


> Capital expenses are expenses that are expected to generate benefits over multiple periods;


> Accounting estimates of asset value begin with the book value, and unless a substantial reason to do otherwise is given, the historical cost is viewed as the best estimate of the value of an asset.


> When a current market value exists for an asset that is different from the book value, accounting convention seems to view this market value with suspicion. The market price of an asset is often viewed as both much too volatile and easily manipulated to be used as an estimate of value for an asset.


> When there is more than one approach that can be used to value an asset, accounting convention seems to take the view that the more conservative (lower) estimate of value should be used rather than the less conservative (higher) estimate of value. Thus, when both market and book value are available for an asset, accounting rules often require that you use the lesser of the two numbers.


> Generally accepted accounting principles in the United States require the valuation of fixed assets at historical costs, adjusted for any estimated loss in value from the aging of these assets. The loss in value is called depreciation.


> Current assets refer to assets with short lives (generally less than a year).


> The accounting convention is for accounts receivable to be recorded as the amount owed to the firm, based upon the billing at the time of the credit sale.


> When one firm acquires another and the acquisition is accounted for with [purchase accounting](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/New_Home_Page/AccPrimer/accstate.htm/goodwill.htm), the difference between the acquisition price and the book value of the acquired firm is called goodwill.


> The second principle is that the value of both the liabilities and equity in a firm are better estimated using historical costs with accounting adjustments, rather than with expected future cash flows or market value.


> Since assets are primarily valued at historical cost or book value, both debt and equity also get measured primarily at book value.


> Current liabilities refer to liabilities that will come due in the next year.


> There are two basic gauges used to measure profitability. One is to examine the profitability relative to the capital employed to get a rate of return on investment. This can be done either from the viewpoint of just the equity investors, or looking at the entire firm. Another is to examine profitability relative to sales, by estimating a profit margin.
