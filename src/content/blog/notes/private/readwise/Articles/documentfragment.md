> The performance benefit of `DocumentFragment` is often overstated. In fact, in some engines, using a `DocumentFragment` is slower than appending to the document in a loop as demonstrated in [this benchmark](https://jsbench.me/02l63eic9j/1). However, the difference between these examples is so marginal that it's better to optimize for readability than performance.
