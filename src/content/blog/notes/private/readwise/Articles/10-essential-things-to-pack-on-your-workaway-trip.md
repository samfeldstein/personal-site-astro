> Backpacks come in sizes based on how many liters they hold. The more the better for long-term trips, but remember liters equal weight and you WILL be carrying your backpack around like a second skin. I’d recommend staying within the 50-60L range. Mine was 68L and when stuffed to the max (when wasn’t it?) it weighed about 16 kilograms, or a little over 35lbs. It’s doable, but lighter is better.


> At most, I’d bring **two pairs of shoes** – a type of sturdy sandal (waterproof) that you could wear in the shower or on the beach and a hiking boot. That way if one pair gets wet you can wear the other. Alternating shoes will also help prevent blisters.
