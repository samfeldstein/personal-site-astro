> The thing I built was a primitive language model and—though I thought it was fascinating, seeing a computer talk—it did not occur to me that it could be useful for much beyond pranks. I would never have guessed that seven years later, the same basic idea scaled up would be intelligent enough to pass university exams.

Really?


> When you multiply this together the growth of effective compute for AI is dramatic, and will likely be so for at least a few years more. (If this trend were to continue for another ten years, all GPUs and skilled software engineers and physicists in the world would have been diverted into AI development—all resources would be gobbled up—so either we hit a full-blown intelligence explosion within a decade, or the trends will slow as they reach a natural constraint.)


> Developing AI systems is increasingly labor intensive—every year, you need more and more people to make the same amount of progress as you did last year. But if part of the “labor force” that is AI itself is diverted into AI development, it might be more than enough to compensate for the increasing labor demands. At current growth rates, AI companies in 2030 will have enough compute to perform ~1.8 million years of work when adjusted to human working speeds.


> In the face of such radical uncertainty, I like C.S. Lewis’s remarks about atomic bombs:
>  > If we are all going to be destroyed by an atomic bomb, let that bomb when it comes find us doing sensible and human things—praying, working, teaching, reading, listening to music, bathing the children, playing tennis, chatting to our friends over a pint and a game of darts—not huddled together like frightened sheep and thinking about bombs. They may break our bodies (a microbe can do that) but they need not dominate our minds.
