> “From across the web” is always going to be **worse for end user performance** than using one coherent, progressive enhancement compatible JavaScript framework per site.


> The dream is that you could just mix and match widgets regardless of what framework each widget is written in, but the truth is the only way to do that is by paying the full price of including a framework for each web component you include on the page. It’s never going to be a practical choice for sites where end user performance matters.


> Use CSS [scope selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@scope) and [import layers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@layer) to create a CSS reset scoped just to your component, and you get all the benefits of Shadow DOM with none of the goth language about “light DOM styles piercing the shadow root” and whatnot.
