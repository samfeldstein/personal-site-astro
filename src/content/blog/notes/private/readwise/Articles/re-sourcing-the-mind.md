> In the essay I mentioned above, Crawford cited remarks from the philosopher Talbot Brewer in an unpublished paper about what he termed “degenerative AI.” As it happens, I’ve also had occasion to hear some unpublished remarks by Brewer through a friend who attended a recent conference. One phrase in particular caught my attention. As I understood it, Brewer argued that dependence on LLMs took the self “out of play.” This is an evocative way of getting at the matter. In the labor of articulation, we put ourselves in play, with all the risks, rewards, burdens, challenges, and consolations that entails. To outsource the labor of articulation is to sideline ourselves.
