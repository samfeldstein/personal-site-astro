> the two most fundamental forms of learning -- classical (Pavlovian) and instrumental (operant) conditioning. Through them, we respectively learn to associate 1) stimuli in the environment, or 2) our own behaviors, with significant events, such as rewards and punishments.


> Classical (or Pavlovian) conditioning is one of the fundamental ways we learn about the world around us. But it is far more than just a theory of learning; it is also arguably a theory of identity. For, once you understand classical conditioning, you’ll recognize that your favorite music, clothes, even political candidate, might all be a result of the same process that makes a dog drool at the sound of bell.


> A [conditioned stimulus (CS)](https://nobaproject.com/modules/conditioning-and-learning#vocabulary-conditioned-stimulus-cs) is a signal that has no importance to the organism until it is paired with something that does have importance.


> Operant conditioning occurs when a *behavior* (as opposed to a stimulus) is associated with the occurrence of a significant event.


> This conditioned compensatory response has many implications. For instance, a drug user will be most “tolerant” to the drug in the presence of cues that have been associated with it (because such cues elicit compensatory responses). As a result, overdose is usually not due to an increase in dosage, but to taking the drug in a new place without the familiar cues—which would have otherwise allowed the user to tolerate the drug (see [Siegel, Hinson, Krank, & McCully, 1982](https://nobaproject.com/modules/conditioning-and-learning#reference-16)).


> A final effect of classical cues is that they motivate ongoing operant behavior (see [Balleine, 2005](https://nobaproject.com/modules/conditioning-and-learning#reference-1)). For example, if a rat has learned via operant conditioning that pressing a lever will give it a drug, in the presence of cues that signal the “drug is coming soon” (like the sound of the lever squeaking), the rat will work harder to press the lever than if those cues weren’t present (i.e., there is no squeaking lever sound). Similarly, in the presence of food-associated cues (e.g., smells), a rat (or an overeater) will work harder for food


> And finally, even in the presence of negative cues (like something that signals fear), a rat, a human, or any other organism will work harder to avoid those situations that might lead to trauma.

When you feel the heat, you worker harder to escape the fire.
Anticipation.


> the conditioned response only occurs during the presentation of stimulus A, because the earlier conditioning of A “blocks” the conditioning of B when B is added to A. The reason? Stimulus A already predicts the US, so the US is not surprising when it occurs with Stimulus B.


> After conditioning, the response to the CS can be eliminated if the CS is presented repeatedly without the US. This effect is called [extinction](https://nobaproject.com/modules/conditioning-and-learning#vocabulary-extinction), and the response is said to become “extinguished.”


> This is called [spontaneous recovery](https://nobaproject.com/modules/conditioning-and-learning#vocabulary-spontaneous-recovery): following a lapse in exposure to the CS after extinction has occurred, sometimes re-exposure to the CS (e.g., the smell of chalkboards) can evoke the CR again (e.g., the agony of detention).


> By watching the behavior of the other kids, the child can figure out the rules of the game and even some strategies for doing well at the game. This is called [observational learning](https://nobaproject.com/modules/conditioning-and-learning#vocabulary-observational-learning).


> Bandura theorizes that the observational learning process consists of four parts. The first is *attention*—as, quite simply, one must pay attention to what s/he is observing in order to learn. The second part is *retention*: to learn one must be able to retain the behavior s/he is observing in memory.The third part of observational learning, *initiation*, acknowledges that the learner must be able to execute (or initiate) the learned behavior. Lastly, the observer must possess the *motivation* to engage in observational learning. In our vignette, the child must want to learn how to play the game in order to properly engage in observational learning.


> children in the aggression group showed less aggressive behavior if they witnessed the adult model receive punishment for aggressing against Bobo. Bandura referred to this process as [vicarious reinforcement](https://nobaproject.com/modules/conditioning-and-learning#vocabulary-vicarious-reinforcement), as the children did not experience the reinforcement or punishment directly, yet were still influenced by observing it.
