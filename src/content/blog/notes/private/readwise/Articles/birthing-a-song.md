> What makes the word nachas special is that it refers to a kind of joy, which derives from the happiness of *others*.


> Sometimes the the music I make puts me in a certain mood. That mood, the intensity of it, is similar to hunger I suppose. When you’re hungry you are desirous. You want something, you need something. There is little intellect involved, only imagination. You might imagine what you’re hungry for: it might be sweet, it might be savory. It might be French toast or a bowl of cherries. It might be grilled fish or roast lamb. Why do we desire a particular food at a particular time? Who knows? I mention this because a kind of hunger often overtakes a songwriter as well.
