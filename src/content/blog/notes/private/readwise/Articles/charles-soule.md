> I create my work in two phases – there’s a lot of initial story-breaking that’s done longhand, in notebooks. I can do that anywhere. Then, the actual scripting usually takes place in my office/studio, which contains a big, open desk without a lot on it other than my laptop, a lamp and a (struggling) plant.


> Virtually every single page I’ve written over the last fifteen years began in longhand. The first draft of my first novel was written by hand, and every story I write now begins as a series of handwritten notes and an eventual detailed outline.
