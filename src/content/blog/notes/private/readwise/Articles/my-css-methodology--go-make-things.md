> There are times where, for practical reasons, it’s not desirable to style things with only utility classes.
>  Buttons, for example, are used often and would require numerous utility classes to style properly. The opportunity to style them _wrong_ by missing a class is too high. And making visual changes would potentially require changing many classes across an entire website.


> At it’s heart, OOCSS is about creating small, modular classes that you can use like Legos. Combine them in different ways to create components.
