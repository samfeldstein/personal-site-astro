> Do I want Iran to be a theocracy? Of course not. I can’t wait for the mullahs to fall from power - but I don’t support the most likely way they get there, which is with the United States destroying the existing government and installing a pliable authoritarian neoliberal client state in its place.

Great. So by that rationale, I don't necessarily want Israel to be a nation state, but I also don't support the most likely way it is to get there, which is for the Israeli Jews to be expelled from Israel or killed.


> We could make a deal and subject Israel to less criticism in exchange for Israel not receiving any American aid.

This assumes that most of the criticism of Israel from Americans stems from American financial support. Which I doubt. I don't think that's what people have on their minds when they criticize Israel. I think the average person is just on the social justice bandwagon. They're aware of the financial support, sure. But their first concern is Israeli oppression of Palestinians.
It could just be a trickle down effect, where American support for Israel accounts for the average American's awareness of Israel, and therefore its wrongdoings. In that sense, it makes sense that Americans would be more aware of what's going on there than in some other country that doesn't receive support from the US. China, or something.
