> We don’t like to be bored, so we fill our time. If you remove all the things you don’t want to fill your life with, then it will fill with the good stuff.


> the stuff I truly enjoy at the deepest part of my being has grown so strong that I can’t be bothered with anything else. If I’m too tired to do meaningful work, have conversations with my friends on Zoom, read books, exercise, or hang out with my wife and kids — then my eyes, well, they fall shut and I snore.


> If you’ve ever looked for a friend in a crowd, suddenly you notice the faces that otherwise would have been a mere background blur.
>  Regarding research, Robin Hanson talks about this goal-driven attention as chasing your reading. If you want to get more value from the books you read, you need to have a goal with your reading — a question you are trying to answer, a problem you are hoping to solve. This applies to using the internet as well, and it applies beyond research. If you go on Twitter looking for ways to contribute to friendly conversations, you will be primed for tweets where you can provide good replies. If you’re on Instagram looking for support in your project renovating a 19th-century door, you will end up in worlds dedicated to that.
