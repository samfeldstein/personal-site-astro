> I’ve seen this cosplay tendency most consistently in startup founders and product owners. They seem to make a cult of working tactically and reactively, always showing a sense of urgency, moving towards a vague vision with no concrete plans or priorities, as if it was less about achieving some goal than about looking the part.
>  This is perhaps explained by the fact that startups live on investor’s money. Their survival is less concerned with accountability and effectiveness than with making a convincing case for investors to keep the money coming in.


> This is the dilemma. Software engineers must choose between imaginary software—where they get to envision and design and architect, where they have agency but their decisions are ultimately meaningless—and legacy software—where decisions have already been made and change is heavily constrained.
