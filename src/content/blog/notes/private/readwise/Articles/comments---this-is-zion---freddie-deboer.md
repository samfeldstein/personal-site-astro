> I basically agree with this, but I think this argument misses the strongest case for Zionism. Which is: The Jewish people have had a long history of living peacefully in cosmopolitan nations where they were welcomed as neighbors... right up until they weren't. Lots of the statistics about Jewish flourishing in America today were also true of Jews living in Europe in the 19th century. It didn't last. Sooner or later, there's always a movement that arises, declares the Jews to be hostile outsiders, and begins the slaughter. We've even got a word for that: pogrom. Zionism is the dream of a land where pogroms are impossible because the basic social, political, and demographic facts make it impossible. Is the US a land where pogroms are impossible? Well, we haven't had one here yet. But we're a young nation with a lot of heavily armed, racist people. Give us time; we'll get there eventually.
