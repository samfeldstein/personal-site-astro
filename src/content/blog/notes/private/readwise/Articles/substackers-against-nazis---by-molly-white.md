> We, your publishers, want to hear from you on the official Substack newsletter. Is platforming Nazis part of your vision of success? Let us knowâ€”from there we can each decide if this is still where we want to be.

I truly don't know what to think about this. Because you can't kill hateful ideas by banning them in public. That doesn't stop people from thinking those ideas, and I've read somewhere that the fringes of society is exactly where hateful ideas flourish. 
So there is a part of me that thinks Substack, and any given platform, belongs just as much to Nazis as it does to anyone else, just as the planet belongs to each of us equally. In other words, none of us has any right to say we have more of a right be here than anyone else.
And yes, I see the irony there. Because Nazi's, among others, do feel like they have more of a right to exist (ie are superior to) other people. But inevitably, any time you adopt a censorship policy, it's going to backfire. What happens when those laws are turned against you?
There's a lot I don't know here. I don't even know if hatespeech is legal. I think it is.
It's also the whole "I can tolerate anything except intolerance." It seems like a noble principle. But then it comes down to how you define intolerance.
