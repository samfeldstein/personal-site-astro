> This text was slightly modified in 1989 and again in 2021, but the upshot remains the same. The rule imposed a speed limit on US airspace. Not a noise standard, [which would make sense](https://www.mercatus.org/media/document/mercatus-dourado-supersonic-transport-v1pdf). *A speed limit*.


> The analogy also corrects a misconception some people have about sonic boom, that it only occurs when an aircraft crosses the sound barrier. Like the wake of a boat, a shockwave is generated the entire time the aircraft is flying supersonic. However, an observer on the ground only hears the boom once, just as someone swimming in a lake only experiences the wake of a boat once as the boat passes by.


> We know from research in sonic boom simulators and from dive maneuver studies that human response to sonic boom is driven almost entirely by the sharpness of the N-wave. If you could round the corners off the N-wave, slowing the rise time of the overpressure on the bow shock, you would have an extremely unobjectionable boom that just sounds like a regular noise.
