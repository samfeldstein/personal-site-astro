> Okay look I thought I knew how a computer works but I really don’t. That’s the [illusion of explanatory depth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusion_of_explanatory_depth).


> There are only a few things you need to know about toilets, cars, and capitalism in order to get what you need out of them. That makes it feel like you know a lot about them, but you don’t. You can flush a million times, drive a million miles, and spend a million bucks without learning much about cars, toilets, or capitalism.


> Not knowing stuff is fine; the real problem is that *we* *don’t know that we don’t know.* Ignorance plus ignorance about your ignorance is a recipe for overconfidence.


> You might think that attention is a *window* between our brains and the world. You peer over here, you peer over there, like a submarine twisting its periscope around. And that’s mostly true, except the window is also a *magnifying glass*, enlarging whatever you see through it. Simply attending to something can make that thing seem more important than it really is.


> I think the focusing illusion is underrated because it may secretly be the reason we do anything at all. We have to make a billion stupid little decisions every day: wear the plaid or the paisley? Order the shrimp fried rice or beef lo mein? Watch the next episode or go to sleep? Almost none of these decisions will actually affect our happiness much at all, but we have to choose *something*. How do we make all these unimportant choices? Maybe our mind tricks us into thinking they’re actually *important* choices. Perhaps a pinch of focusing illusion helps us quickly pick the shrimp over the beef and move on with our day, but a pile of focusing illusion sends us spiraling: *shrimp! no, beef! no, wait, shrimp!*


> That’s why, even though the planning fallacy is highly rated, it’s still wildly underrated. There should be more conversations that go like this:
>  “I’ll probably finish my novel in six months.”
>  “Planning fallacy.”
>  “I’ll probably finish my novel in a year.”
>  “PLANNING FALLACY!"
>  “I’m never going to finish my novel."

But what if being over optimistic about what you can achieve makes you achieve more? Like if you want to lift 200 pounds and you go to 250?
