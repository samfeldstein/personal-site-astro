> When tech platforms are quick to banish posters, partisans of all stripes have an incentive to accuse their opponents of being extremists in an effort to silence them. But when platforms are too permissive, they risk being overrun by bigots, harassers, and other bad-faith actors who drive away other users, as evidenced by the [rapid erosion of Twitter](https://variety.com/2023/digital/news/musk-twitter-x-acquisition-one-year-user-revenue-decline-1235770297/), now X, under Musk.

What does "overrun" mean though? It's not like I started seeing Nazi propoganda in my Twitter feed.
