> *Conviction that there is an answer.* This is where there’s a cruelty to problem-solving: if you are solving exercises that are collected in a book, it’s implicit that each of those problems has a solution. Puzzle books are a forgiving problem-solving environment in that way. It means that you can bang your head against the problem for hours, because you know that there is a findable answer, and that you will find it if you simply apply enough determination and search hard enough.

This is why coding is easier than writing!
