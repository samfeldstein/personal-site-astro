> A NATO [report](https://stratcomcoe.org/publications/hybrid-threats-hamas-use-of-human-shields-in-gaza/87) from 2019 noted that Hamas’s use of human shields is based on two central ideas: an awareness of Israel’s desire to minimize civilian casualties and of the Western public’s reaction to civilian casualties.


> the Hamas-run health ministry doesn’t differentiate between civilians and terrorists. This means that there is no way to know how many of the casualty figures are civilians.


> The health ministry, run by Hamas, also does not specify how many casualties were caused by the IDF, labeling all such incidents as “Israeli aggression.” This means that casualties that resulted from misfired Hamas rockets or similar circumstances are included in the count.


> Many of the entrances to these tunnels — which are widespread and often deeply buried — are located in or near civilian buildings, such as homes, schools, mosques and hospitals.


> Additionally, Hamas often stores its rockets and other weapons in homes and schools. The U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which is usually hesitant to criticize Hamas, has [reported](https://www.unrwa.org/newsroom/press-releases/unrwa-condemns-placement-rockets-second-time-one-its-schools) finding Hamas’s rockets in schools run by the agency and tunnels beneath these schools.
