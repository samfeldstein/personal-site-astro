> What’s also striking is the lack of its opposite. “It’s okay to dislike things, as long as you acknowledge the ways they’re”… I don’t even know how to finish that sentence. “Unproblematic” just means “the absence of problems.” There’s no social-justice word for things being *good*.

No belief in things that make the world better. Only things that make the world worse, and things that don't.


> It’s not like bizarre opinion-policing can only happen one way. You can imagine a culture where before saying “I don’t like Nicki Minaj” you have to acknowledge that she’s a woman of color who [gives large donations to anti-global-poverty charities](https://www.businessinsider.com/nicki-minaj-donate-village-india-2017-5). But that’s not the culture we wound up with.

I guess, but there's no need to justify liking something that doesn't hurt anybody, much less something that helps a lot of people.
