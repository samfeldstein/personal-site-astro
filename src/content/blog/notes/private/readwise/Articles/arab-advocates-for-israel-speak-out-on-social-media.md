> Rawan Osman, 40, was on her fourth trip to Israel this year when we dined outdoors at a Jerusalem restaurant in mid-September.


> Cairo native Dalia Ziada, another Muslim woman I interviewed who publicly, including on social media, supports Israel and opposes Iran and its anti-Israel military proxies, stated that she, too, hears from Arabs who back her but fear saying so aloud. Israeli Arabs Joseph Haddad and Jonathan Elkhoury, both Christians, stridently speak and tweet on the subject. A British-American Muslim, Elica Le Bon, has appeared regularly on television interviews and on social media to denounce her parents’ homeland of Iran and support Israel’s fight. So has Matthew Nouriel, a British-American Jewish activist whose parents also are Iranian. Another stalwart has been Mossab Hassan Youssef, a Muslim-turned-Christian native of Ramallah who in 2010 attained asylum in the United States and whose father was a founder of Hamas.


> On a video call, Ziada, 42, told me that she feared for her life after condemning the Oct. 7 attacks and secretly fled Egypt hours after a fatwa, or religious edict, called for her death. Ziada said she notified Cairo police officials, who refused to protect her on the grounds that she supported Israel. She’s since lived in Washington, D.C.
