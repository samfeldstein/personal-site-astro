> using static web pages for your site does not preclude things that people generally associate with dynamic sites (like templates, newsboxes, stock tickers, etc.). Nor does it mean that your site can’t have any interaction or collaboration (comments, boards, polls). While these things obviously won’t work if you move platforms or server software, at least the content already on your site won’t die. The key is to keep a strict separation between input (which needs dynamic code to be processed) and output (which can usually be baked).
