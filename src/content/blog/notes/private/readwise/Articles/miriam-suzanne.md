> I don't like any of the writing apps I've tried (most of them). Word processors are too much, [Scrivener](http://web.archive.org/web/20190626125457/http://www.literatureandlatte.com:80/scrivener.php?) is even more, and code editors are too little. Everything specialized is too nerdy when I'm collaborating on a script. [iA Writer](https://ia.net/topics/ia-writer-for-mac) is pretty, but I can't teach every new collaborator how to use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). When it comes to collaboration, the choice is between real-time editing (awful) or sending files back and forth (worse). There should be better options.
