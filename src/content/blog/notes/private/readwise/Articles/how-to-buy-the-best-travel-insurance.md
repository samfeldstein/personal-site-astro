> make sure your travel insurance offers a high coverage limit on your medical expenses. A good company will provide up to $100,000 USD in coverage care, though more expensive policies will cover you for higher amounts. The maximum coverage limit you can find is around $2,000,000 USD, though I’m not sure why you would ever need a limit that large.


> make sure your travel insurance policy also covers emergency evacuation and care that is separate from your medical coverage. If you are hiking in the woods and you break your leg, your policy should cover your evacuation to the nearest acceptable medical facility.


> If a natural disaster occurs and you need to be evacuated to somewhere else, your plan should cover that as well. This protection should cover an expense of up to $300,000 USD.
>  Additionally, make sure you understand if your evacuation coverage will pay for you to get home or if it will just send you to the nearest acceptable facility.


> great travel insurance plans always include the following provisions:
>  • Coverage for most countries in the world (including the places you plan on visiting).
>  • Some coverage for your electronics (and have the option for a higher coverage limit).
>  • Coverage for injury and sudden illnesses.
>  • Offer 24/7 assistance (you don’t want to call to be told to call back later).
>  • Coverage for lost, damaged, or stolen possessions like jewelry, baggage, documents, etc.
>  • Coverage for cancellations for hotels, flights, and other transportation bookings if you have a sudden illness, death in the family, or some other emergency.
>  • Coverage for political emergencies, natural disasters, or strife in the country that causes you to head home early.
>  • Financial protection if any company you are using goes bankrupt and you are stuck in another country.


> Travel insurance is *accident* insurance. It is there to protect you in case of emergency and, if need be, get you home in a hurry.
