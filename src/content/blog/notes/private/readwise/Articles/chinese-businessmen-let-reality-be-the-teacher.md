> Over the last couple of years, I’ve looked for but never found a correlation between education and business skill in the Chinese businessmen I’ve dealt with. If anything, the more educated ones seemed hampered by their thoughtfulness. The successful ones, on the other hand, seemed pathologically biased towards action. This bias made me uncomfortable. If the educated man always looks before he leaps, the successful Chinese businessman seemed to me to be overly biased towards leaping.


> Broadly speaking, there are [two basic approaches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_and_error) to problem solving: trial and error, and theory and insight. It’s difficult to overstate how much we are driven towards theory and insight by the formal education we receive.
>  Consider the problem of bridge building. The trial and error approach to bridge building would be to slap together a bunch of things until you find a design that works. Today, this approach is considered horrifying and is never used. We have since worked out the underlying physics of bridges, and have developed sophisticated tools to design them. Structural engineers can tell whether a design would work even before construction begins; an engineer who gets things wrong, in fact, would find himself shamed by society, and punished severely by the professional bodies in his industry.
>  And so we internalise: “trial and error is a stupid way to build bridges” and extend that. We think: “study hard in school; learn math, physics and engineering, and you will be able to *save yourself from error*.”


> The good news is that thinking deeply and then acting is optimal for fields where a body of knowledge exists. But in fields where little is known, or where things change too quickly for theory to find handholds, trial and error dominates as the superior problem solving strategy. In these fields, failure is an acceptable cost of learning. In these fields, thoughtfulness takes on a different form.


> When the cost of failure is low, when the effort of testing is cheap, and when there is much that is unknown, trial and error is usually the optimal strategy to pursue.
