> **So how did it play itself out on set, for example, him being a charming asshole?**
>  I say, “Hugh, in this scene, you’re wearing these sunglasses and we’re paying a lot of money for Hugh Grant. Would you be completely against the idea of not wearing sunglasses in the scene?” This is a negotiating technique I learned. The answer you always want to get from your counterpart is “no,” not “yes.”


> **How did you invent how you wanted to be onstage—the persona?**
>  It’s like sculpting. Sculpting is removing everything that isn’t the sculpture you want to make. You’re not adding; you’re removing. Stone sculpture, not clay. So, when you do a joke and it gets a laugh and something inside you doesn’t feel quite right, you don’t do that joke. You do the jokes that you feel connect to your anger, your attitude, your personality. Success in comedy is very much a—conducting. So, the face, the voice, the body, the joke—when all of that is working together, it hits. Bang. You just feel it. You feel it like hitting a baseball on the button. And, when one of them is a little off, it’s not there.

Ah. Permission to trash something just because I don't like it, granted. And by implication, permission also granted to keep something just because I do like it.
