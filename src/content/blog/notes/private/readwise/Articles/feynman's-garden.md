> Feynman’s thinking algorithm is described like this:
>  1. Write down the problem
>  2. Think real hard
>  3. Write down the solution


> The trick is that there is no trick. This is how thinking works. It appears that when you feed your brain related information, without further active involvement, it starts to digest the information you’ve fed it.


> Thinking is a background process. There’s no Sherlock Holmes-style string of brilliant deductions; the brain is a connection-making machine. If you feed it data points, it will find ways of connecting the dots.


> To answer the question, what you do next is to remove yourself from further inputs. As long as you keep feeding your brain with more data, the queries never resolve, and eventually the stuff you fed it first will fall out of the context window and amount to nothing.
>  For this reason, it’s crucial to step away from the keyboard. Go for a walk, or sit down in a quiet place, take a shower; whatever you choose to do, just keep thinking about the problem.


> *The conclusions must be written down*. Not only because these insights are fleeting and can be hard to recall, it also appears to act as a sort of feedback to the brain that the information is important, that it’s on the right track, to keep going.
