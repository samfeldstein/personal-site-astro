> Alan Gerber, Mark Grebner, Donald Green and Christopher Larimer (2006) find that voters turn out at higher rates when they believe that the status of their participation will be made public within their neighborhoods.


> ** The content of mobilization messages is not as important as the quality, timing and delivery of messages, which is not to say that message content does not matter at all.


> In 2000, when Alan Gerber and Donald Green published results of canvassing, phone calls and direct mail mobilization experiments, they noted that turnout did not vary significantly across messages of differing content (civic duty, close election and neighborhood solidarity).


> Nickerson finds that messages that focused on comparisons of candidates were more effective than messages that focused on comparisons of parties in mobilizing turnout.


> The question of whether professional or volunteer phone banks are more effective in increasing turnout is equally as contested as the debate about partisan versus nonpartisan messages.


> Nickerson’s findings suggests that whether or not callers are seasoned, paid professionals matter less than the quality and timing of the delivery of the messages. Mobilizing voters through phone calls may be a question of volunteer or professional oversight as well as strategically timing when the calls are placed in the course of the campaign.
