> > *Most men will not swim before they are able to.” Is that not witty? Naturally, they won't swim! They are born for the solid earth, not for the water. And naturally they wont think. They are made for life, not for thought. Yes, and he who thinks, what’s more, he who makes thought his business, he may go far in it, but he has bartered the solid earth for the water all the same, and one day he will drown.*
>  *(Hermann Hesse- Der Steppenwolf)*


> Weird Nerds are distinguished by their unyielding devotion to Truth, often placing it above social graces or conventional norms.


> This species, while occasionally difficult to interact with, plays a crucial role in society, acting as an innovator and “village truth-teller”.


> In the last decades, Weird Nerds have found a sanctuary within the confines of academia, a natural habitat where their traits are not only tolerated, but often nurtured. In this symbiotic relationship, the wider world benefits from the intellectual pursuits and discoveries of the Weird Nerd, without the need to engage directly with its often annoying demeanour. It's a situation that seems to maintain a harmonious balance: the Weird Nerd is protected from “drowning”, while society at large reaps the rewards of its unique contributions without having to deal directly with it.


> Confronted with this altered habitat, The Nerd often finds itself in a state of distress and confusion. Its intrinsic motivation clashes with the newly imposed corporate-like order and the demand for conformity, leading to frantic efforts to assert its natural tendencies.

Examples?


> Through an ad hoc analysis, Jason discovered that while 66% of the top national winners at the Intel/Westinghouse Science Fair from 1990 to 2002 pursued careers in academia, this number dropped to less than a third for winners from 2003 to 2014. Now, for this to support my and Nate’s observations, you have to assume the Science Fair winners are good representations of the Weird Nerd. I personally think that’s a valid assumption!


> There’s a real risk here that even start-ups will run out of stuff to build on if high-quality fundamental research will cease to be done in academia.
