> to be a hacker you have to get a basic thrill from solving problems, sharpening your skills, and exercising your intelligence.


> You also have to develop a kind of faith in your own learning capacity — a belief that even though you may not know all of what you need to solve a problem, if you tackle just a piece of it and learn from that, you'll learn enough to solve the next piece — and so on, until you're done.

It probably wasn't until I started coding that I learned this. Nothing else I've tried to do, for whatever reason, convinced me that I'm smart enough to learn.
