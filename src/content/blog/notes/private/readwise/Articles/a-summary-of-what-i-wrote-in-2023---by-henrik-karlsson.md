> These essays tell the story of my relationship with Johanna up until the birth of Maud. They were interestingly _hard_ to write. I thought a lot about why this is. I think it has to do with the fact that our traditional narrative forms center conflict, which means that love stories tend to be anything butâ€”they tend to be stories of infatuations, toxic romance, failed expectations, and so on. Writing about healthy, transformative love breaks our narrative forms. This means we rarely see it portrayed in fiction.

I think this wrong, and he's being a little conceited. Has he never heard of romantic comedies? Or even most romances? Those are all about the transformative power of true love! Disney movies? Harry Potter? Come on.
You're not that special, Henrick.
