> It can be scary to tweet, and you may feel pressure to play a certain character or tweet for engagement. I personally got over this by thinking of tweets as a type of public timestamped journal of notes to myself; an index of what I was thinking about at the time. Over time, this builds up and can be a powerful creative tool. Youâ€™re best off just letting go of all self-consciousness -- which happens by doing it a lot -- and then treating it as a creative exercise *for yourself*.
