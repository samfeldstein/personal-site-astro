> Upon submitting, the data name/value pair gets sent to the server. In this instance, the string will be `text=usertext`, where "usertext" is the text entered by the user, encoded to preserve special characters. Where and how the data is submitted depends on the configuration of the `<form>`; see [Sending form data](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Sending_and_retrieving_form_data) for more details.
