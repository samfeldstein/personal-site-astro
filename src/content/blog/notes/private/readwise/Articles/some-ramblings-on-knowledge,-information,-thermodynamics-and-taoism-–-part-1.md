> It’s not that Nonaka & Takeuchi’s description was invalid; it represented a giant leap forward in our understanding of how knowledge is transferred, absorbed, aggregated and embedded in the social psyche. But their presentation of ‘knowledge’ in tacit and explicit forms hooked-in to our Western way of black-or-white thinking (you’re either with us or against us...) to fool us into assuming that they were separate and separable concepts. They are not.


> “This paper by Crofts provides a theoretically sound basis to distinguish knowledge without substance from information embodied in the structure of a thermodynamic carrier. As you suggest, knowledge and information are both distinct yet inseparable. However, for me this drives a stake through the notions of explicit knowledge and collective knowledge. Explicit information certainly, but knowledge - no.”


> Reading that recorded representation demands translation and interpretation to reproduce the original meaning. What's important about this sequence is that the knowledge enacted by the author through writing, the storage & transmission medium, and the reader are parts of a thermodynamic system that propagates meaning from one mind to another's mind. Hence, knowledge only exists in the mind of each individual.


> Crofts is interested in the information content of the entire biosphere (‘life’), and information transmission within biological systems. This interest spans the entire gamut from the information that is coded in DNA, up to human language and other abstractions of human consciousness. All life processes involve *work*, and work depends on there being an energy gradient, and is subject to the second law of thermodynamics, which predicts that these gradients tend to equalise over time, leading to an increase in that part of energy which is unavailable for work, and which we call *entropy*. It is the fate of the universe to evolve to a state where all energy gradients disappear, no further work is possible, and life comes to an end.
