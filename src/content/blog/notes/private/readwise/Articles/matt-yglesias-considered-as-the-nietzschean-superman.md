> Ozy Brennan has a self-help post, [The Life Goals Of Dead People](https://thingofthings.substack.com/p/the-life-goals-of-dead-people). It’s framed as mental health advice. Maybe you’re some sort of guilty/anxious doormat type person. Your goals are things like:
>  • I don’t want to make anyone mad.
>  • I don’t want to hurt anyone.
>  • I want to take up less space.
>  • I want to need fewer things.
>  • I don’t want to fail.
>  • I don’t want to break the rules.
>  • I don’t want to offend anybody
>  • I don’t want to have upsetting emotions.
>  • I want to stop having feelings.
>  Ozy points out that dead people achieve these kinds of goals better than the living ever could. If your overarching life goal is to be more like a dead person, that’s a red flag for being a guilty/anxious doormat type person who needs to gain some self-confidence.
>  They suggest considering replacing some of these with the sorts of goals where living people outperform corpses. For example:
>  • I want to write a great novel.
>  • I want to be a good parent to my kids.
>  • I want to help people.
>  • I want to get a raise.
>  • I want to learn linear algebra.
>  • I want to watch every superhero movie ever filmed.


> If people can be judged on their accomplishments, then it seems like you should go out and get some accomplishments, ie embiggen yourself. If people can only be judged on their harms, it seems like you should try to avoid causing harm, ie ensmallen yourself. So another way to think about slave vs. master morality is as coefficients on the normal utilitarian equation, *good = benefits - harms*. Master moralists overweight the benefits term; slave moralists focus on the harms.


> You replace the normal cost-benefit calculus with your own version that [ignores benefits and obsesses over harms](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/book-review-from-oversight-to-overkill). Scientific geniuses, lofty reformers, great altruists - all of their actions probably hurt a couple of people along the way to revolutionizing society, so only people who have never done anything at all are truly pure. If everybody who has accomplished things is a bad person, then you win by default.


> you may not be interested in slave morality, but slave morality is interested in you. Master morality *isn’t* interested in you - the masters are out achieving things and conquering places, they’re not going to take time out of their day to turn missionary and “convert” you to master morality too. But slave moralists are obsessed with ideological purity and invested in cutting down anybody who’s less slave moralist than they are. Even if you find it easy to avoid yourself, you need to be prepared to live in a slave morality world.
