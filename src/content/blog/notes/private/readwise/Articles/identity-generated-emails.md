> For successful use of the `{{ .ConfirmationURL }}` variable, your site landing page must include the [Identity widget](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-identity-widget). If the Identity widget is not on the landing page, you must customize the path the emails link to so that visitors are sent to a page that includes the widget.
