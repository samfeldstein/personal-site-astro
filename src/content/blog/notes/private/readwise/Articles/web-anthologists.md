> The problem with organizing content chronologically is that it makes everything ephemeral by default. Even if at a slower pace than social media, blogging still submits us to the clock: _when_ is more important than _what_, and _when_ only really matters if it’s _now_. And that’s OK for a lot of the stuff online, content that is best left forgotten or to be rewritten, but it means that conscious and consistent efforts are necessary if we intend to find and preserve good content that wasn’t _just published_. Just as we need discovery and curation to navigate through information overflow, we need archiving and anthologizing to stay aware of what came before.


> why should I care more about what the author writes next than what they wrote before?
