> This is completely true. If your goal is to build the absolute fastest framework you can, then you want to minimize DOM nodes wherever possible. This means that web components are off the table.


> That said – and I might alienate some of my friends in the web performance community by saying this – performance isn’t everything. There are other tradeoffs in software development, such as maintainability, security, usability, and accessibility. Sometimes these things come into conflict.


> When I see this kind of stuff, I’m reminded of [speedrunners trying to shave milliseconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rIJNT7dCmE) off a 5-minute run of Super Mario Bros using precise inputs and obscure glitches. If that’s your goal, then by all means: [backwards long jump](https://ukikipedia.net/wiki/Backwards_Long_Jump) across the entire stage instead of just having Mario run forward. I’ll continue to be impressed by what you’re doing, but it’s just not for me.


> > [I]n a sense there are nothing wrong with Web Components as they are only able to be what they are. It’s the promise that they are something that they aren’t which is so dangerous.
>  Here I totally agree with Ryan. As [I’ve said before](https://nolanlawson.com/2023/08/23/use-web-components-for-what-theyre-good-at/), web components are bad at a lot of things – Server-Side Rendering, accessibility, even interop in some cases. They’re good at plenty of things, but replacing all JavaScript frameworks is not one of them.
