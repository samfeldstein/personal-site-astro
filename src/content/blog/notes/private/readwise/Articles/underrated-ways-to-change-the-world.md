> I meet lots of idealistic folks who think that all they’re missing is money, or credentials, or access to the levers of power. More often, what they’re really missing is *friends*. Only a crazy person can toil alone for very long. But with a couple of buddies, you can toil pretty much forever, because it doesn’t feel like toil. That’s how you end up with what economic historians call “[efflorescences](https://culturahistorica.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/goldstone-efflorescences.pdf)” and Brian Eno called “[scenius](https://monoskop.org/images/c/c6/A_Year_With_Swollen_Appendices_Brian_Enos_Diary.pdf)“ (“scene” + “genius”): hotspots of cool stuff. And for that, we need not just a Francis Bacon, but also a whole gang of Right Reverend Wilkinses.


> So it’s up to us. When I wrote [There’s a Place for Everyone](https://www.experimental-history.com/p/theres-a-place-for-everyone) a few months ago, I got a lot of messages that were like, “Well, there’s certainly no place for *me*.” That breaks my heart. Look at the world! See it aching! It’s got so many problems—I promise you, there’s one with your name on it.
