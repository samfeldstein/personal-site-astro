> Defenders of the modern Israeli state are in this constant argumentative bind: they must ceaselessly insist that Israel is teetering on the brink of destruction, in order to keep American money and weapons and diplomatic muscle flowing, while at the same time claiming that Israel is the only place where Jews can be safe.

I agree that the idea that Jews would go to Israel to feel safe feels a little silly. In part, though, that only feels silly because so much of the world is committing to drawing ire towards Israel, if not destroying it ouright.
They could also be arguing that the only reason Israel is safe is because of the money and weapons and diplomatic muscle. Which isn't contradictory. His framing is convenient.


> Well, some tell me, Israel *is* a safe home for Jews, but only *because* of American largesse. If that’s true, then the modern state of Israel is surely doomed, as no patron, even the United States, remains the hegemon forever. If Israel can’t survive the end of American economic, military, and diplomatic support (for political or practical reasons, it makes no difference), then Israel has an expiration date, simply by dint of the inevitable cycles of history.


> If you hold Zion to be not a geographic location but a concept of Jewish safety and success, you could hardly ask for a fuller realization of that ideal than what you find in the Jewish experience in the United States.


> And if letting Israeli Jews relocate to a huge and rich and advanced part of the world that actually wants them results in the end of the unconscionable treatment of the Palestinian people, it sure looks like a win-win for everybody.

So the only way to have peace over there is if all the Jews leave? That might be true (I mean, it wouldn't be, if it's going to be like every other place in the middle east), but I don't like it. Why are we the ones who have to leave?
