> Repeated information is often perceived as more truthful than new information. This finding is known as the illusory truth effect, and it is typically thought to occur because repetition increases processing fluency.


> In both experiments, we found that perceived truthfulness increased as the number of repetitions increased.


> The largest increase in perceived truth came from encountering a statement for the second time, and beyond this were incrementally smaller increases in perceived truth for each additional repetition.


> Furthermore, the effect does not depend upon the source of the statements (Begg et al. [1992](https://cognitiveresearchjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41235-021-00301-5#ref-CR8)) and occurs even when participants are explicitly told that the source of the statements is unreliable (Henkel and Mattson [2011](https://cognitiveresearchjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41235-021-00301-5#ref-CR31)) or when the initial statement had a qualifier that cast doubt on the statement’s validity (Stanley et al. [2019](https://cognitiveresearchjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41235-021-00301-5#ref-CR55)).


> Further evidence of the robustness of this effect comes from studies showing that the illusory truth effect even occurs when the repeated statements are highly implausible (e.g., *The earth is a perfect square;* Fazio et al. [2019](https://cognitiveresearchjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41235-021-00301-5#ref-CR21)) or when the repeated statements directly contradict participants’ prior knowledge (e.g., *The fastest land animal is the leopard;* Fazio et al. [2015](https://cognitiveresearchjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41235-021-00301-5#ref-CR20)).


> Processing fluency refers to the metacognitive experience of ease or difficulty that accompanies a mental process (see Alter and Oppenheimer [2009](https://cognitiveresearchjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41235-021-00301-5#ref-CR3)).


> Habituation is a form of learning that occurs across species, and it refers to the fact that as the number of repetitions of a given stimulus increases there are exponential decreases in the frequency of the associated behavioral responses (for a review see Rankin et al. [2009](https://cognitiveresearchjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41235-021-00301-5#ref-CR49)).
