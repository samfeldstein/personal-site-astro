> We know the hedonic treadmill is powered by *adaptation*: good things feel good at first, then they feel less and less good until they just feel neutral. To beat the treadmill, then, we have to figure out clever ways of resisting adaptation and keeping good feelings fresh.


> Most nice things get less nice over time, whether it’s a slice of cheesecake, a massage, or houseguests. *Disrupters* refresh pleasant experiences by interrupting them.


> Commercial breaks––[people actually enjoy TV](https://hbr.org/2010/10/defend-your-research-commercials-make-us-like-tv-more) *[more](https://hbr.org/2010/10/defend-your-research-commercials-make-us-like-tv-more)* [with commercials](https://hbr.org/2010/10/defend-your-research-commercials-make-us-like-tv-more)

Fascinating. I guess that's a result of building anticipation.


> *Cutoffs* are the ultimate disruptors because they end the experience entirely. A well-timed cutoff can prevent the inevitable dip in pleasure that comes at the end of most things, whether it’s the last lukewarm gulp of a formerly cold lemonade, the awkward multiple goodbyes at the end of an otherwise excellent conversation, or the one day too many at the beach that leaves you bored and sunburnt.


> Resisting adaptation doesn’t necessarily require *worse* experiences, just *different* ones. *Variators* are little modulations that keep experiences fresh.


> All good things must come to an end. *Recyclers* bring them back again. Your hiking trip in the Himalayas may only last a week, but the memories can last a lifetime––if you can find ways of recycling them.


> We tend to judge experiences by [their peaks and their ends](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1467-9280.1993.tb00589.x?casa_token=ayr5Kf_FekgAAAAA:FNZ9vd-OFuwj_RgPtSMrGRn0S7sfnBBBOBJ1h0LghDKMiLkJvut6S81Swj67OzVDBXiGxKoQA26S).


> A well-executed peak is the thing you reminisce about years later––not just spending a week at Cabo, but the one morning when you woke up with your partner to watch the sunrise and stood in the sand and smelled the sea and watched an old couple walking on the beach holding hands and imagined yourselves being them one day.


> The Maverick is a marvel of hedonic design. The ride begins with a literal *peak*, a 105-foot hill with a 95-degree drop. The track is packed with *variators*, banks and turns and flips and something called a [“twisted horseshoe roll.”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roller_coaster_element#Twisted_horseshoe_roll) Then there’s a *disruptor*: the train comes almost to a standstill inside a tunnel, convincing first-timers that either the ride is over or something’s gone wrong. Then another *peak*: you suddenly accelerate to 70mph in three seconds, blasting out of the tunnel and into the sky. The *finale* is a rapid-fire series of banks, spins, and a flight over a canyon where you dodge cannons firing water plumes. The *cutoff* comes after a mere 150 seconds, just before your brain is totally liquified inside your skull. *Recyclers* are available as you stagger off the ride: they’ve taken a photo of you screaming your head off, and you can take it home for a mere $20.

Dance as hedonic design. That is the leader's job.


> Of course, even the finest hedonic design has its limits. It can’t turn sadness into gladness; hoisting someone out of depression takes more than tweaks. So if you’re feeling very bad, get a therapist, not a set of designer socks in different colors.
