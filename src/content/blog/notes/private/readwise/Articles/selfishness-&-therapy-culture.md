> What disturbs me so much is the notion that the only criteria for deciding whether a behavior is worth doing is the individual’s own emotional comfort. That, and my sense that Caron has no idea she’s endorsing it.
>  > “If you’re asking the question about whether or not you forgive, move away from the question and ask, ‘What do I need to work on to free myself?’” said Dr. Bakari, who holds a doctorate in educational psychology.
>  Who told you that your job in life is to free yourself? “Freeing yourself” is very often the opposite of pursuing moral action. Very often, the reason that there’s someone who you might or might not forgive, the reason for the offense, is precisely because that person had freed themselves in an entirely inappropriate manner. (A lot of the world’s most predatory people are those who feel much too free.)


> I have spent a good deal of time pointing to bizarre and unhealthy Instagram self-help [meme culture](https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/trauma-memes-are-dangerous). I admit that this is often a matter of picking low-hanging fruit, which is fun and easy because a lot of this stuff really is deranged and people find it entertaining when I make fun of it. But I actually do think it’s important on a more meaningful level. I am convinced that the never-ending adult enculturation process we’re all undergoing all the time is far more directed by the minor influences of ordinary life - ambient cultural attitudes, day-to-day exposure to coworkers and friends and social media and television - than it is by abstract political, religious, and moral concepts. And the culture that we’re creating genuinely frightens me.
