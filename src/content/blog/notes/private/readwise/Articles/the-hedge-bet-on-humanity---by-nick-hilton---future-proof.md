> In its potential scale, the AI revolution is often likened to the Internet revolution. That seems eminently possible. But there’s another potential future where the impact is more akin to the way that computer generated visual effects developments impacted cinema. The dawn of CGI had two major impacts: it damaged the practical effects industry, and it enhanced the visual effects industry. But for 99% of the world’s population, whose only interaction with cinema is as consumers, it changed nothing. One day they were watching _Nosferatu_, the next they were watching _Twilight_. Behind the scenes this may have been a sea change, but, for most people, it was a relatively cosmetic alteration to a product.


> I mentioned that I felt irked when people described themselves as “AI artists” because they successfully typed a few words into Dall.E and exported bizarrely eroticised hyperrealistic portraits of men and women.

In essence, how is this different from making art with CSS? The only difference, as far as I can tell, is in the level of expertise required to use the tool.
When you paint with CSS, you didn't draw all the pixels yourself. You manipulated a tool. How is that different, fundamentally, from using a paintbrush? And how is punching keys to manipulate CSS different from punching keys to manipulate an LLM? You are still issuing instructions to a machine, then does the work for you. As far as I can tell, the only difference is the language you enter the directions in.
