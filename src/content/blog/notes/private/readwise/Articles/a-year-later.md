> Hamas has become exceptionally vile, criminal, and nihilistic during this war, instructing its soldiers to fight in civilian clothes. Worse, its fighters have been explicitly engaging in firefights and attacks from civilian areas so as to maximize civilian casualties from Israeli retaliation, which Hamas hoped would delegitimize Israel and stop the war.


> What was exceptionally damaging about Hamas is that it sabotaged an opportunity to allow the Gaza Strip to become an effective model for Palestinian self-governance and an example of what an occupation-free West Bank could look like. Gaza should have been spared the destructive wars that distracted from its development so that it could reach its true potential as the crown jewel of a future Palestinian state. This is what “Islamic resistance” movements do: They waste Arab people’s potential, steal their resources, and use anti-Israel sentiments as Trojan horses to gain power, wealth, and control. The people of Gaza are aware of this and have been for years, even if they could not effectuate change to rid themselves of Hamas’s dictatorial military rule over them.
