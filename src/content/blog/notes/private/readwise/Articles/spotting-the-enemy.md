> While these services by psychologists are well-known, some of psychology’s wartime contributions have received little fanfare. This is the case of work by Samuel Renshaw (1892–1981), an Ohio State University experimental psychologist whose research on improving human perception, memory and learning made a dramatic impact during WWII.
>  Initially, Renshaw studied ways to improve reading speed. In his lab, subjects would be exposed to a series of numbers flashed on a screen for increasingly shorter durations of time. After the subjects were trained, Renshaw claimed that they could read faster with the same level of comprehension. He also trained students to improve their sense of taste. His students developed such distinguished palates that some were hired by the local inspection board to perform taste checks at local bars to ensure that liquor supplies had not been watered down.
