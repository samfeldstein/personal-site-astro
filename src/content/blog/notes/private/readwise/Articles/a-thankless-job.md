> In the wake of his disastrous monologue we’ve heard from comedians like [Kevin Hart](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/kevin-hart-never-host-oscars-1235787056/?ref=humorism.xyz), [Michael Che](https://www.foxnews.com/media/snls-michael-che-says-comedians-boycott-awards-show-hosting-gigs-celebs-sensitive?ref=humorism.xyz), [Howard Stern](https://www.thewrap.com/jo-koy-golden-globes-monologue-comedians-time-writers/?ref=humorism.xyz), Laurie Kilmartin, and of course [Koy himself](https://variety.com/2024/awards/news/jo-koy-slams-golden-globes-stand-up-jokes-1235870905/?ref=humorism.xyz) that hosting an awards show is a thankless job, A-listers are just too tough of a crowd, they're humorless, they're cold, they're soft, Hollywood simply doesn’t respect comedians. Even if this were all true, so what: the job is to do a hard thing, and we’ve all seen people do it well. These reactions seem to reflect the cognitive dissonance that afflicts so many famous comedians (and non-famous ones, for that matter), who treat the audience as the ultimate judge of quality when it’s on their side and as a bunch of oversensitive snowflakes when it’s not. The comedian is never responsible for his failures; he is, in fact, their victim.
