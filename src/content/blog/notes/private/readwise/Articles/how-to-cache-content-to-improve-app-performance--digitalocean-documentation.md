> By default, App Platform deploys static sites with `Cache-Control` headers set to cache for 24 hours on CDN edge servers and 10 seconds in web browsers. If you redeploy the app, any cached content is invalidated across the web and CDN servers and web browsers will cache the latest iteration of the website upon any new traffic to the app.
