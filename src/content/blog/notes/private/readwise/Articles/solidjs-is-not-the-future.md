> There’s really only one JS metaframework I can think of that’s achieved some popularity in recent years and for good reason, and that’s [Astro](https://astro.build/). And the thing which makes Astro rather awesome is precisely *because* you can start with real vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—and then go beyond that only when and where you need to.


> If React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, Solid, etc. all simply “poofed” out of existence tomorrow and all we had to build web applications with were vanilla APIs & web components, a tiny handful of tiny userland libraries for a healthy splash of DX, and good ol’ fashioned server-side web framework stacks in a variety of server-side languages which have been trucking along just fine for the past 20+ years, **that would be perfectly fine with me**.
