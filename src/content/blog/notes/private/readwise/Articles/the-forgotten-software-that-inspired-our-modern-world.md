> In a fantastic computer advertisement from the 1980s, the programming language Logo – co-created by Seymour Papert – billed itself thus: “Logo has often been described as a language for children. It is so, but in the same sense that English is a language for children, a sense that does not preclude its being also a language for poets, scientists, and philosophers.”
