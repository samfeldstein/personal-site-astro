> This is called [audience design](https://nobaproject.com/modules/language-and-language-use#vocabulary-audience-design) ([Fussell & Krauss, 1992](https://nobaproject.com/modules/language-and-language-use#reference-9)); speakers design their utterances for their audiences by taking into account the audiences’ knowledge.


> The number of people engaging in a conversation at a time is rarely more than four. By some counts (e.g., [Dunbar, Duncan, & Nettle, 1995](https://nobaproject.com/modules/language-and-language-use#reference-7); [James, 1953](https://nobaproject.com/modules/language-and-language-use#reference-14)), more than 90 percent of conversations happen in a group of four individuals or less.


> people in conversation tend to exhibit similar accents and rates of speech, and they are often associated with people’s social identity ([Giles, Coupland, & Coupland, 1991](https://nobaproject.com/modules/language-and-language-use#reference-10)). So, if you have lived in different places where people have somewhat different accents (e.g., United States and United Kingdom), you might have noticed that you speak with Americans with an American accent, but speak with Britons with a British accent.


> a staggering 60%–70% of everyday conversation, for both men and women, turned out to be gossip—people talk about themselves and others whom they know. Just like Adam and Ben, more often than not, people use language to communicate about their social world.


> Dunbar ([1996](https://nobaproject.com/modules/language-and-language-use#reference-5)) conjectured that gossiping is the human equivalent of grooming, monkeys and primates attending and tending to each other by cleaning each other’s fur.


> When people use language to describe an experience, their thoughts and feelings are profoundly shaped by the linguistic representation that they have produced rather than the original experience per se ([Holtgraves & Kashima, 2008](https://nobaproject.com/modules/language-and-language-use#reference-13)).


> Potentially because of these effects of verbalizing emotional experiences, linguistic reconstructions of negative life events can have some therapeutic effects on those who suffer from the traumatic experiences ([Pennebaker & Seagal, 1999](https://nobaproject.com/modules/language-and-language-use#reference-21)). Lyubomirsky, Sousa, and Dickerhoof ([2006](https://nobaproject.com/modules/language-and-language-use#reference-19)) found that writing and talking about negative past life events improved people’s psychological well-being, but just thinking about them worsened it.
