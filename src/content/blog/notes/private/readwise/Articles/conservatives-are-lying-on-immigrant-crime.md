> it’s not surprising that an increase in migration has not led to an increase in crime, as it’s been known for decades that legal migrants commit much less crime than natives, and the differences are quite large. Illegal immigrants are about equal to natives or slightly higher, but since legal immigrants compose the majority of all arrivals, the net impact of immigration on crime is to lower it.
