> In some situations, exploiting too early is disastrous; you’ve committed to something that wasn’t right for you. It’s useful to spend some time, especially in your youth, trying out different interests, ambitions, places, people. But exploring for too long is also risky—I think that’s what the well-known Sylvia Plath quote (the figs, the tree, the indecision) is all about.[2](https://www.personalcanon.com/p/and-since-i-have-never-said-youth/#footnote-2)
>  So there has to be some year where you decide: in *this* part of my life, I know what I value. I am choosing; I am committing. And now I’m thinking of another idea I came across years ago—it must have been after I’d finished my bachelor’s, when I first started working as a designer—about devoting a year to [going deeper, not wider](https://www.raptitude.com/2017/12/go-deeper-not-wider/).


> But now I feel I’ve found some of *my things*, and so 2025 is the year I switch strategies. I’ve been writing this newsletter for 1 year. Worn the same lipstick color for 3 years.[3](https://www.personalcanon.com/p/and-since-i-have-never-said-youth/#footnote-3) Written my morning pages, as prescribed by Julia Cameron’s *The Artist’s Way*, for 4 years. Dated the same woman for (almost!) 5 years. Had the same eyeglasses for 6 years—the frames, not the prescription, since my eyesight keeps getting worse. I didn’t know that these things would stick, but it’s nice to observe where my life has naturally become more consistent, more settled.


> This may strike you as a tremendously boring way to live, especially for someone who’s always seeking out new books, ideas and encounters. And it’s true: since commitment reduces the choices you can make, it *does* produce monotony! But that monotony is what lets me make new choices elsewhere. My energy is reserved for going deeper; instead of figuring out what new interest to try, I’m going further in my existing ones, especially in my writing.


> In *The Bell Jar*, Plath writes (bolding mine):
>  > I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out. **I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest**, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.
