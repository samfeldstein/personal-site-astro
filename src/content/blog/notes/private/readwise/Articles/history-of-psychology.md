> Introduction


> The work of Locke, Reid, and others emphasized the role of the human observer and the primacy of the senses in defining how the mind comes to acquire knowledge.


> The question of the relationship between the mental (experiences of the senses) and the material (external reality) was investigated by a number of German researchers including Ernst Weber and Gustav Fechner. Their work was called [psychophysics](https://nobaproject.com/modules/history-of-psychology#vocabulary-psychophysics), and it introduced methods for measuring the relationship between physical stimuli and human perception that would serve as the basis for the new science of psychology ([Fancher & Rutherford, 2011](https://nobaproject.com/modules/history-of-psychology#reference-8)).


> The formal development of modern psychology is usually credited to the work of German physician, physiologist, and philosopher Wilhelm Wundt (1832–1920).


> In 1879, he complemented his lectures on experimental psychology with a laboratory experience: an event that has served as the popular date for the establishment of the science of psychology.


> William James, G. Stanley Hall, and James McKeen Cattell were among a group that became identified with “[functionalism](https://nobaproject.com/modules/history-of-psychology#vocabulary-functionalism).” Influenced by Darwin’s evolutionary theory, functionalists were interested in the activities of the mind—what the mind does.


> Opposed to the reductionist ideas of Titchener, James proposed that consciousness is ongoing and continuous; it cannot be isolated and reduced to elements.


> Influenced by the work of Darwin’s cousin, Frances Galton, Cattell believed that mental abilities such as intelligence were inherited and could be measured using mental tests.


> The Gestalt psychologists proposed that the mind often processes information simultaneously rather than sequentially. For instance, when you look at a photograph, you see a whole image, not just a collection of pixels of color.


> behaviorism rejected any reference to mind and viewed overt and observable behavior as the proper subject matter of psychology.


> Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov (1849–1936) influenced early behaviorism in America. His work on conditioned learning, popularly referred to as classical conditioning, provided support for the notion that learning and behavior were controlled by events in the environment and could be explained with no reference to mind or consciousness ([Fancher, 1987](https://nobaproject.com/modules/history-of-psychology#reference-6)).


> The turn toward a cognitive psychology was not new. In the 1930s, British psychologist Frederic C. Bartlett (1886–1969) explored the idea of the constructive mind, recognizing that people use their past experiences to construct frameworks in which to understand new experiences.

Is that the same as empiricism?


> Clinical psychology was also an early application of experimental psychology in America. Lightner Witmer (1867–1956) received his Ph.D. in experimental psychology with Wilhelm Wundt and returned to the University of Pennsylvania, where he opened a psychological clinic in 1896. Witmer believed that because psychology dealt with the study of sensation and perception, it should be of value in treating children with learning and behavioral problems. He is credited as the founder of both clinical and school psychology ([Benjamin & Baker, 2004](https://nobaproject.com/modules/history-of-psychology#reference-3)).
