> Long-tail user needs, like “Is this passable at low tide?” represent a comparatively small group of people, yet the investment required to build an adequate solution often remains the same.


> In complexity science, ‘emergence’ describes the way that interactions between individual components in a complex system can give rise to new behavior, patterns, or qualities.

gestalt?


> The mid-20th century saw the apex of *high modern design*. This paradigm was characterized by a hubristic disregard for context, history, and social complexity in favor of an imposed rational order and universal standardization. “Rational” in this paradigm describes a state of superficial geometric efficiency as conceived by the designer.


> In high modernism, not only does the designer exert near-total control over the design, he also operates under the assumption that he holds all relevant knowledge about the design problem.


> In contrast to high modern design, *user-centered design* takes a more modest position; the designer does *not* inherently know everything, and therefore she must meticulously study the needs and behaviors of users in order to produce a good design.


> User-centered design suggests identifying well-trodden ‘desire paths’ and designing for them (in this case by paving a new sidewalk).


> While user-centered design discards the high modern assumption that the designer always knows best, it retains the idea that the designer should maintain control. In this paradigm, design is about gaining knowledge from the user, identifying desirable outcomes, and controlling as much of the process as possible to achieve those outcomes. ‘Design’ remains synonymous with maximizing control.


> In practice, user-centered design tends to privilege the modal user at the expense of the long-tail user whose needs may be just as great.


> User-centered design tends to optimize for the average


> To borrow another metaphor from [Papert (and Mitchel Resnick](https://gordonbrander.com/pattern/low-floor-wide-walls-high-ceiling/)), design for emergence needs:
>  • Low floors (an easy way to get started)
>  • Wide walls (many possible paths)
>  • High ceilings (ways to work on increasingly sophisticated projects)


> [Notion](http://notion.so/) is a philosophical descendent of HyperCard (turns out you can even buy a third-party [HyperCard-themed Notion template](https://nikkiccccc.gumroad.com/l/HyperCardOSNotionTemplate)) that offers extremely adaptable information structures built from an alphabet of ‘content blocks’.
