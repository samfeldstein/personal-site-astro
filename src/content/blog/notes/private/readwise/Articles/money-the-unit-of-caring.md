> And yes, spending money is more painful than volunteering

disagree


> The act of donating money is not the momentary act of writing the check, it is the act of every hour you spent to earn the money to write that checkâ€”just as though you worked at the charity itself *in your professional capacity,* at maximum, grownup efficiency.


> Some people are frugal and spend less money on *everything;* but if you would, in fact, spend $5 on a burrito, then whatever you will not spend $5 on, you care about *less than* you care about the burrito. If you don't spend two months salary on a diamond ring, it doesn't mean you don't love your Significant Other. ("De Beers: It's Just A Rock.") But conversely, if you're *always* reluctant to spend *any* money on your SO, and yet seem to have no emotional problems with spending $1000 on a flat-screen TV, then yes, this *does* say something about your relative values.
>  Yes, frugality is a virtue. Yes, spending money hurts. But in the end, if you are never willing to spend any units of caring, it means you don't care.
