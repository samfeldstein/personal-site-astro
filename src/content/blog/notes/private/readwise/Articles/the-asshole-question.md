> Some years ago, in a typically juvenile response to a juvenile Dutch cartoon about Mohammed, the mullahs in Iran ran a cartoon exhibit of anti-Semitic cartoons (I guess they couldn’t think of enough clog jokes, so they went after Jews). The cartoons featured Jews with big noses, Jews with bags of money – the usual yawn and drang. Calls were made for censure, for boycotts, for international condemnation. One Israeli, though, Amital Sandy, a graphic designer in Tel Aviv, decided to fight fire with humor: he decided to hold his own contest for anti-Semitic cartoons. After all, who’s better at hating Jews than Jews? “No Iranian,” he said, “will beat us on our home turf!” Hundreds of entries were submitted. Art Spiegelman was one of the judges. The cartoons were sick and twisted, gleefully so. By comparison, the mullah’s cartoons were tame. Call it Jew Jitsu. It didn’t take the mullahs from power, that is the Iranians task, but they shut the fuck up.

> For every minute the Klan assholes stood in the town square and blathered on about Jews and blacks and homosexuals, money would be donated to the Klan’s most despised causes: to the Simon Wiesenthal Center, to the NAACP, to the ACLU.
>  The 45-minute Klan rally wound up raising over $10,000.
>  They called it Project Lemonade.
