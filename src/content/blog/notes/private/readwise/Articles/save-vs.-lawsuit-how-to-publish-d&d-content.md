> What the OGL really does is designate a bunch of stuff in the D&D rulebooks as “fair game.” It’s called Open Gaming Content. And all of it is spelled out in a sister document called the System Reference Document (SRD). If something appears in the SRD, it is open gaming content. You can refer to it, you can quote it, you can reproduce it, you can modify it, you can change it, you can include it in your product.


> when you publish through the DM’s Guild, WotC lets you get away with A LOT.
>  Basically, as long as you’re not publishing something offensive or inappropriate (however they define that), you can publish D&D content and pretty much use ANYTHING you want from any published D&D book. You can even use specific settings, as long as those settings are the Forgotten Realms and Ravenloft. You can also publish setting neutral content. You can publish classes, monsters, maps, adventures, backgrounds, spells, magic items, anything you want. And you even get to call it D&D and you can say Drizzt in it or Faerun or beholder.
>  Neat, huh? What’s the catch? Well, the catch is that, as David Flor discovered, you are NOT allowed to sell your content through ANY OTHER channel.
