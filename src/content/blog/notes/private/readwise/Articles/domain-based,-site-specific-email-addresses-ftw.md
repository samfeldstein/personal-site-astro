> There are numerous benefits to this approach. First, it makes it easy to identify who is spamming your inbox. Think about it. When you use the **same email address for everything**, and the spam starts rolling in, you really have no idea which company sold you out. Just have to suck it up.
>  But with the domain-based approach, the email address **lets you know exactly whodunnit**. For example, if you set up an email alias such as `hot-clues@my-domain.tld` for some hot new app, and then a year later you start getting hammered with spam at that address. Well, you know that “hot new app” sold your email to the highest bidder in the spam markets.


> **Another big benefit** of domain-based email is **flexibility and control**. A good example for this is [closing online accounts](https://perishablepress.com/deleting-unused-online-accounts/). If you’re using the same (primary) email address for everything, you have no choice but to jump through all the hoops to close an account. But with site-specific email addresses (aliases), you can just delete the email alias and never hear from the company again.


> If you’ve already got a host for your website or whatever, you’re more than halfway there. In most cases setting up domain-based email is a breeze. Any decent web host will be more than happy to help you get set up in a jiffy.
