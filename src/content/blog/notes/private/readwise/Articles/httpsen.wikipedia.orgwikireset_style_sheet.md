> My technology invention takeaways from all this: 
>  1. if you find yourself repeatedly solving the same (especially annoying) problem, create a re-usable solution that works for you 
>  2. write up your problem statement / use-case in only one sentence 
>  3. publish your solution (on your personal site[⁴](https://tantek.com/2024/263/t1/20-years-undohtml-css-resets#t5Z51_note-4)), name it something short, with only a short paragraph description, and re-use/remix friendly license (like Creative Commons)

> And things not to worry about (that may get in your way to publishing): 
>  1. perfecting or making your solution “big enough” or “the right size”. does it solve your problem? then it’s already the right size. 
>  2. coming up with the perfect name. instead, name it what it does. someone might come up with a better name weeks, months, or years later. let them run with it! 
>  3. waiting to blog multiple things. I could have blogged undohtml.css by itself, probably should have, and instead lumped it into a blog post with another CSS thing I came up with.
