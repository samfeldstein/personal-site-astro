> The lessons of October 7th should have been clear, and they will persist however the war in Gaza ends. Absorbing these lessons does not require that we untangle the wretched history of the region or reconcile the discrepant memories of its peoples. Rather, the moral order of the present can be understood _by reference to the present_, and by honestly acknowledging what both sides to this conflict actually want. When considering the ethics of any group or population, we should never hesitate to ask: _What would these people do if they had the power to do it?_


> Take a moment to do the cognitive work: Imagine the Jews of Israel using _their own_ _women and children as human shields_. And then imagine how Hamas, Hezbollah, al-Qaeda, the Islamic State, or any other jihadist group would respond. The image you should now have in your mind is pure, moral surrealism. It is a Monty Python sketch wherein all the Jews die.
