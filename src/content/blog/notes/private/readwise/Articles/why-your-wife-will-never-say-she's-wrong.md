> Many women struggle with depression, and the most common type is [atypical depression](https://www.drpsychmom.com/2015/04/26/atypical-depression-are-you-tired-and-hungry-and-easily-hurt-emotionally/). One hallmark of this is rejection sensitivity. This means that your wife is so sensitive to being potentially rejected or criticized that she is highly defensive when she feels others think she is wrong. An example of how this manifests is [here](https://www.drpsychmom.com/2016/04/14/cant-take-criticism-feel-guilty-im-bad-wife-mom/). Depending on how fragile she is emotionally, she may or may not be able to admit even to herself that she is wrong, and certainly will not admit it if she feels she is being attacked. If she is rejection sensitive, any comment will feel like an attack.
