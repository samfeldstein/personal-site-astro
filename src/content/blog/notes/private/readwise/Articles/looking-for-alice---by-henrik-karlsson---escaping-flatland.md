> Some people think Stein was lying when she said she wasn’t lesbian. And they are disappointed by that. The fact is that most people Stein liked happened to be gendered like Alice, and hers is the right attitude: you do not like a category. You like individuals. And you’re not born knowing which kind.
>  So what do you do? You go talk to a thousand people (increasingly less randomly sampled) and see if there are any patterns in who makes you feel excited and alive and true and heard. And then you start hanging out with people like that.
