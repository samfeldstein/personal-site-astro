> Frenzy warriors wearing the skins of wolves called *ulfheðnar* ("wolf-skin-ers" or possibly "wolf-heathens"; singular *ulfheðinn*), are mentioned in the *[Vatnsdæla saga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatnsd%C3%A6la_saga)*, the *[Haraldskvæði](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haraldskv%C3%A6%C3%B0i)* and the *[Grettis saga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grettis_saga)* and are consistently referred to in the sagas as a group of berserkers, always presented as the elite following of the first Norwegian king [Harald Fairhair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harald_Fairhair).


> *[Egil's Saga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egil%27s_Saga)* features a man called Kveldulf (*Evening-Wolf*) who is said to have transformed into a wolf at night.


> Within the sagas, Berserkers can be narrowed down to four different types. The King's *Berserkr,* the Hall-Challenging *Berserkr*, the *Hólmgangumaðr*, and the Viking *Berserkr*


> Some scholars propose that certain examples of berserker rage had been induced voluntarily by the consumption of [drugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug) such as the [hallucinogenic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucinogen) [mushroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushroom)[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berserker#cite_note-Fabing-37)[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berserker#cite_note-39)[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berserker#cite_note-40) or massive amounts of [alcohol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)).[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berserker#cite_note-41) This is much debated[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berserker#cite_note-:0-42) but the theory is further supported by the discovery of seeds belonging to the plant henbane *[Hyoscyamus niger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyoscyamus_niger)* in a Viking grave that was unearthed near Fyrkat, Denmark in 1977.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berserker#cite_note-43) An analysis of the symptoms caused by *Hyoscyamus niger* are also similar to the symptoms ascribed to the berserker state, which suggest it may have been used to generate their warlike mood.
