> Givers think that conversations unfold as a series of *invitations*; takers think conversations unfold as a series of *declarations*. When giver meets giver or taker meets taker, all is well. When giver meets taker, however, giver gives, taker takes, and giver gets resentful (“Why won’t he ask me a single question?”) while taker has a lovely time (“She must really think I’m interesting!”) or gets annoyed (“My job is so boring, why does she keep asking me about it?”).


> Conversations, like improv scenes, start to sink if they sit still.


> When done well, both giving and taking create what psychologists call *[affordances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance)*: features of the environment that allow you to do something.


> There’s some recent evidence that what makes conversations pop off is indeed the social equivalent of doorknobs. You might think that the best conversationalists wait patiently for their partners to finish talking before they start concocting a response in their head. It turns out that [we like people the best when they respond to us the fastest](https://www.pnas.org/content/119/4/e2116915119)—so fast (mere milliseconds!) that they must be formulating their reply long before we finish our turn. Abundant affordances allow for this rapid-fire rapport, each utterance offering an obvious opportunity to respond.


> We [overestimate the awkwardness of deep talk](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/psp-pspa0000281.pdf) and so we stick to the boring, affordance-less shallows. Conversational affordances often require saying something at least a little bit intimate about yourself, so even the faintest fear of rejection on either side can prevent conversations from taking off. That’s why when psychologists want to jump-start friendship in the lab, they have participants answer a [series of questions](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0146167297234003) that require steadily escalating amounts of self-disclosure (you may have seen this as [“The 36 Questions that Lead to Love”](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/09/style/no-37-big-wedding-or-small.html)).
