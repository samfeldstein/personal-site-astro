> Meanwhile, the book has its own plan, by which I mean: things have been happening all along (in the language, in the things characters are doing and saying, even in the structure itself) that are actually indicating a sort of shadow book - the book your book really wants to be.
>  Actually, of course, this is the *real* book, but often we aren’t able to see that book (because we are so wed to our original idea of of the book). 
>  (There’s the trip we imagine we’ll have when we set out for NY to LA - and then there’s the actual trip. The sooner we get over our attachment to the imagined trip, the better we’re able to see and enjoy the reality of the actual trip.)


> A book is *better* - it reads better, it’s more fun to read - when we let it go its own way.  It starts throwing off sparks of happiness whenever we honor its intentions.
