> Thatâ€™s the sign of a great abstraction. It allows us to operate as if the underlying complexity simply doesn't exist. We take advantage of the benefits, while the abstraction keeps the hard stuff out of sight, out of mind.


> A useful rule of thumb for assessing an abstraction is to ask yourself: How often do I need to peek under the hood? Once per day? Once per month? Once per year? The less often you need to break the illusion, the better the abstraction.
