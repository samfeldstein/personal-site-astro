> What Dunn and her colleagues found was that, after all the spending had been done, the people who had spent the money on others were happier than those who had spent the money on themselves. In other words, spending on others causes us to be happier than spending on ourselves.


> random assignment makes it so the groups, on average, are similar on all characteristics except what the experimenter manipulates.


> Random assignment is critical to experimentation because if the only difference between the two groups is the independent variable, we can infer that the independent variable is the cause of any observable difference


> what if we want the teams to be fair? How can we do this when we have people of varying height and ability? All we have to do is randomly assign players to the two teams. Most likely, some tall and some short people will end up on your team, and some tall and some short people will end up on the other team. The average height of the teams will be approximately the same.


> A related idea is [participant demand](https://nobaproject.com/modules/research-designs#vocabulary-participant-demand). This occurs when participants try to behave in a way they think the experimenter wants them to behave.


> In a double-blind procedure, neither the participant nor the experimenter knows which condition the participant is in.


> When scientists passively observe and measure phenomena it is called correlational research.


> participant observation is a distinct methodology that involves the researcher embedding him- or herself into a group in order to study its dynamics


> Another qualitative method for research is the case study, which involves an intensive examination of specific individuals or specific contexts.


> At the same time, there are too few people who have this type of injury to conduct correlational research.


> Narrative analysis centers around the study of stories and personal accounts of people, groups, or cultures. In this methodology, rather than engaging with participants directly, or quantifying their responses or behaviors, researchers will analyze the themes, structure, and dialogue of each person’s narrative. That is, a researcher will examine people’s personal testimonies in order to learn more about the psychology of those individuals or groups.


> Every person has a unique perspective on the world, and studying the way he or she conveys a story can provide insight into that perspective.


> Another powerful research design is the [longitudinal study](https://nobaproject.com/modules/research-designs#vocabulary-longitudinal-study). Longitudinal studies track the same people over time.


> the strength of a scientific finding lies in the strength of its methodology.
