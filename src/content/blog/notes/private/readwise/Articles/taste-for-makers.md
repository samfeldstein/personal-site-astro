> Saying that taste is just personal preference is a good way to prevent disputes. The trouble is, it's not true. You feel this when you start to design things. 
>  Whatever job people do, they naturally want to do better. Football players like to win games. CEOs like to increase earnings. It's a matter of pride, and a real pleasure, to get better at your job. But if your job is to design things, and there is no such thing as beauty, then there is *no way to get better at your job.* If taste is just personal preference, then everyone's is already perfect: you like whatever you like, and that's it.


> As in any job, as you continue to design things, you'll get better at it. Your tastes will change. And, like anyone who gets better at their job, you'll know you're getting better. If so, your old tastes were not merely different, but worse. Poof goes the axiom that taste can't be wrong.


> When you're forced to be simple, you're forced to face the real problem. When you can't deliver ornament, you have to deliver substance.

> Humor is related to strength. To keep one's sense of humor is to shrug off misfortunes, and to lose one's sense of humor is to be wounded by them. So the mark of strength is not to take oneself too seriously. The confident will often seem to be making fun of the whole process slightly, as Hitchcock does in his films or Bruegel in his paintings--or Shakespeare, for that matter.


> When you have to climb a mountain you toss everything unnecessary out of your pack. And so an architect who has to build on a difficult site, or a small budget, will find that he is forced to produce an elegant design. Fashions and flourishes get knocked aside by the difficult business of solving the problem at all.


> Not every kind of hard is good. There is good pain and bad pain. You want the kind of pain you get from going running, not the kind you get from stepping on a nail. A difficult problem could be good for a designer, but a fickle client or unreliable materials would not be.


> If you just try to make good things, you'll inevitably do it in a distinctive way, just as each person walks in a distinctive way. Michelangelo wasn't trying to paint like Michelangelo. He was just trying to paint well. He couldn't help painting like Michelangelo.
