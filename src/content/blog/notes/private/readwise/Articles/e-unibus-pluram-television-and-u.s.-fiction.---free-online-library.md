> Lonely people tend to be lonely because they decline to bear the emotional costs associated with being around other humans.


> Americans' oversensitivity to real humans fixes us before the television and its ball-check valve in an attitude of rapt, relaxed reception. We watch various actors play various characters, etc. For 360 minutes per diem, we receive unconscious reinforcement of the deep thesis that the most significant feature of truly alive persons is watchableness, and that genuine human worth is not just identical with but rooted in the phenomenon of watching.

He's striking some kind of cord here but it only works if Americans have been shown to be more self-conscious than other cultures. That self-consciousness is the cord he's striking. I've spent most of of my life being ruthlessly self-conscious, and I think a lot of other people have too.
Then again, I spent far less time, especially as a kid, in front of the tv than the average American.
