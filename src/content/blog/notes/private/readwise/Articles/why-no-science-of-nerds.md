> Different groups navel-gaze in different ways. Broadway musical writers write a bunch of musicals about what it’s like to be on Broadway. Poets write a bunch of poems about writing poetry. Philosophers speculate on how philosophy may be the most truly virtuous activity. Psychoanalysts analyze the *heck* out of the inner mental experience of psychoanalyzing someone.
>  All this leaves me a little surprised that there isn’t more scientific study of nerds.

There’s more than one type of nerd. People who like Star Wars and DnD and fantasy novels are also nerds, but they’re better at writing than math.
Nerd is probably too broad a category to be studied properly. All his other examples do one specific thing and nerds don’t. You can be a writer and bad at math or you can be good at math and bad at writing. Either way, you’re a nerd.
Doesn’t necessarily explain why nerds don’t study themselves, especially if their definitions are narrow in the same way.
Maybe nerd is an aesthetic more than anything.


> “Nerds” seem to share a bunch of seemingly uncorrelated characteristics. They’re generally smart. They’re interested in things like math and science, especially the hard sciences like physics.

I associate the word with kids who like fantasy and play dnd.


> The other possibility is that in fact these traits are all correlated for some reason, and people who are bad at sports really *are* more likely to enjoy math, less likely to drink or use violence, et cetera. “Nerd” would then be a natural category, in the same way that, for example, “bird” is a natural category pointing out that animals with feathers are more likely to have wings, beaks, et cetera rather than a totally random distribution of traits. Why would that be?

Could it just be that people use what they have? They aren’t athletic, so they develop other interests. And maybe they aren’t any better suited to those interests, but if they aren’t, it won’t be obvious in the way it’s obvious that they aren’t good at sports.


> People who are good at math might be so transfixed by the mysteries of the universe that things like sports and socializing and dating pale in comparison.

Generous interpretation. I think more likely they’re just terrified of other people, especially those they’re attracted to.
