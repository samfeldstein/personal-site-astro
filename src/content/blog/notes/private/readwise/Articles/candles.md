>  > Why do religions comfort? They comfort because the stories they tell involve divine beings who know everything and who can, often, save us all from the horror of death. We live in a world of intractable and painful moral questions that we feel that we can never resolve; religion says that there are divine beings who know the right answers, and that’s comforting. We miss our loved ones who have died terribly; many religions say that we will one day be reunited with them, and that’s comforting.

He's quoting Freddie deBoer. It's a paid article so I can't read it. But this quote, as with many quotes about religion, is narrow-minded in the sense that the writer's views on religion are clearly informed by Christianity. Judaism, for instance, fits that description not at all. God doesn't know everything, and there is no standard notion of an afterlife.


> I would also note that while most people think that Buddhism is a religion, it typically doesn’t do or have *any* of the things that Freddie says religion does and has. I can’t now remember who said it, but one scholar of religion claimed that the *only* thing all religions have in common is that they use candles. That seems right to me.


> “religion” is an intractably fuzzy concept, the many religions of the world do many different things and do them in many different ways, and even within a given religion people may believe and may commit themselves for as astonishing variety of reasons. The whole enterprise, if indeed we can call religion an enterprise, is so fraught with complications that I don’t think there’s *anything* that can be legitimately said *in general* about it. It’s like life itself in that respect.
