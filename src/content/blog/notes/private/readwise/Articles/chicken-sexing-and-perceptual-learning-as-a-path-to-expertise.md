> Expert sexers *can’t* explain how they know. They just … do. And the people they train *can’t explain it any better than they do*.

Ability knowledge


> Perceptual exposure works because it leverages the brain’s ability to detect underlying patterns and structure. In simple terms: given a **large set** of **superficially different examples**, the brain will pick out *that which does not vary*.


> In her 2015 book *Badass: Making Users Awesome*, Kathy documents the requirements for effective perceptual learning in the service of creating better, more usable, more learnable products.
>  The key, Sierra says, is to show users a **large number** of **diverse, positive examples** within a **compressed time**.


> Take language, for instance. If English is your first language, the sentence “play football I like to” should immediately set off alarm bells in your head. You don’t need to think in terms of grammatical rules to know that this sentence is wrong — your brain has already recorded the deep patterns of English, so you know you’re looking at a badly formed sentence by simple comparison with the recorded patterns in your head. This is the fruit of perceptual exposure in action.


> Sierra continues:
>  > This doesn’t mean we can’t teach using examples of bad, but the best, safest place for that approach is long after the learner develops strong perceptual knowledge for what’s good. Once they’re reliable at perceiving good, they’ll automatically recognize bad as “that which doesn’t fit the pattern” (even if they can’t explain why).


> I suspect this effect is what is meant when writers say “read a lot, because if you want to write well, you must know what good writing looks like”.


> There are two common attributes among experts. Two things that people with high expertise did that others didn’t. Besides the right type of practice (Deliberate Practice), master performers did something else that didn’t feel like practice. In fact, they might not have known they were doing anything at all.
