> My favorite all-time quote might be Steve Jobs saying this:
>  When you grow up, you tend to get told the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world. Try to have a nice family life, have fun, save a little money. That’s a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. Once you learn that, you’ll never be the same again.


> Leaving your comfort zone and having it turn out okay is an incredibly powerful experience. Each time it happens, it chips away at your respect for your brain’s ingrained, irrational fears.
