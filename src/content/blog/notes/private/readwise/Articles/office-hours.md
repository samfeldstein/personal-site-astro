> Writers who publish are people who have found a way to say what they have to say that is enjoyable for a reader to read.


> We see evidence of talent in things like rhythm and ear and all of that. But the real evidence of talent is that feeling we get, when reading a wonderful writer, that we are in good and wise hands – in the presence of an unusual mind.


> And, for me, this has always been exciting – the thought that, if I broaden my personhood, by reading and thinking and discussion and travel and adventure (and meditation, and prayer), my work will absolutely get bigger – it will ask harder, more pertinent questions (because why wouldn’t it, having been out in the world like that)?


> Failure, so-called, might mean that we “don’t have talent,” but I don’t like that thought.  It doesn’t help me do my work. I’d prefer to say that failure means we haven’t yet found the exact flavor of our talent – the mode in which we sound and read most like our true self.
