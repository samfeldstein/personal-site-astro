> Claudia Goldin [won the Nobel Prize](https://time.com/collection/women-of-the-year/6691521/claudia-goldin/#:~:text=That%20day%2C%20she%20became%20only,to%20studying%20women%20and%20work.) for her work showing that [motherhood](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w30323/w30323.pdf?utm_campaign=PANTHEON_STRIPPED&%3Butm_medium=PANTHEON_STRIPPED&%3Butm_source=PANTHEON_STRIPPED) is one of the most important factors, if not the chief one, that causes gender pay disparities[1](https://www.writingruxandrabio.com/p/pro-progress-will-win-when-it-wins/#footnote-1).


> discussing an underrated source of the gender wage gap: that is, the difference in how much men and women value "meaning” at work. On average, women value meaning, or doing what is considered socially valuable work more than men and are willing to accept what are usually lower salaries in order to engage in such work.

Bigger still is the gender difference in whether the job is helpful to others or useful to society. The share of women who say they value jobs which help others say is 8.2 percentage points higher than that of men.


> This means that at least to some extent, what careers women choose to pursue can serve as a barometer of what society considers pro-social, meaningful and of positive impact to the world.


> My observation aligns with Alice’s suggestion that women might be underestimating the social benefits of more lucrative careers like those in STEM because of a culture that vilifies the products of market forces.


> Yet the common wisdom that most young people passively internalize is that for-profit work is generally icky, that corporations are greedy and that non-profit work and governmental intervention is what will change society for the better.
