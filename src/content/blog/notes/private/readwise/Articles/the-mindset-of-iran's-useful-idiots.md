> Let’s face it. Keffeyas are cool. They can be worn around the neck and shoulders. They can hide faces, giving the wearer an air of mystique. And is it not easy to imagine that part of the allure of the Hitler Youth, and the Brown Shirt movement — and everything that made the Nazi ideology so appealing to so many young people was the refined aesthetic of the clothing, the banners, the symbols, and regalia of the Nazi movement? In a word — it was cool. And nothing is “cool” if it doesn’t purvey some sort of sexual appeal. Tragically, in both instances —the growing allegiances to radical Islam, and in the 30’s, the Nazi movement —what’s become cool is the hatred of Jews and the world’s only Jewish state. Simply put: For many, it is now sexy to hate Jews.
