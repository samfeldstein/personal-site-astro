> When we talk about “local-first,” we’re primarily talking about where data lives and how it syncs to our devices.


> And now, everyone here is trying to make a new, beautiful local-first future happen, where the software and the data all live on our local machines and just use the cloud to sync between them whenever we get internet access.


> there's an interpretation of local software that means software that is built close to the home and serves the needs of the home.
>  It’s software someone might build for themselves, their family and friends, their neighborhood and community.
>  It solves local problems for local people.


> Home-cooked apps, like meals, are apps you make for the people you know and love.


> My friend Kasey Klimes wrote a fantastic piece called “[When to Design for Emergence](https://newsletter.rhizomerd.com/p/when-to-design-for-emergence)” on the design dynamics of large-scale software after working on Google Maps.
>  He points out that our current approach is designed to only solve the most common needs of the most number of users.
>  Anything beyond that is what we call the long tail of user needs. These are things only a few people need, but there's a nearly infinite amount of them.


> In the current system, this stuff is always considered out of scope.
>  Because it doesn't make any financial sense to support the long tail.


> I'm also talking about what's come to be called agents.
>  This is when we get large language models to behave like an agent that can make plans and decisions to try and achieve goals we give them.


> we get them to mimic logical thought patterns like having them observe what they know, plan what they want to do next, critique their own work, and think step by step.
>  The agent gets to decide what tool it wants to use at any one point to solve the problem we've given it.


> The program was a wild success. By the mid-1970s, there were over 1.5 million barefoot doctors serving in China's villages.
>  Life expectancy over that period rose dramatically from 35 years to 63 years.


> But they never make it over what I call the command line wall.
>  They never end up in the terminal, because that is a huge jump in complexity, usability, and frustration from using something like Airtable or Notion.
