> Under the DMsGuild program, you can publish D&D material that has no setting or uses the Forgotten Realms, Ravenloft, Eberron, Ravnica, Theros, Arcavios(Strixhaven), Radiant Citadel, Spelljammer, or Dragonlance settings.


> Wizards does not own any of the unique IP that you create in your publications. Wizards does own the IP that they contribute, plus the DMsGuild agreement will grant Wizards and other DMsGuild authors a license to use your IP.
