> A new politics must encourage dialogue across the partisan divide. As the new postscarcity paradigm takes hold, we may discover a lot of common ground that is being obscured by the old paradigm and old habits of thought. A new politics will require progressives to recognize that the fringe elements on the Right that promote or exploit racism, xenophobia, hate, or authoritarianism, which have no place in a pluralistic, democratic society, are, indeed, fringe. They are not representative of true conservatism. It will also require conservatives to recognize that the fringe elements on the Left that try to enforce Orwellian notions of acceptable thought and speech, what conservatives dub “political correctness,” are also fringe. They are not representative of true liberalism.
