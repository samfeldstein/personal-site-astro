> Let go of this idea that you have to find this one great thing. That is my passion, my great passion. With your shirt torn open and your heaving, pec muscles.
>  It's embarrassing. Just be willing to do your work as hard as you can with the ability you have. We don't need the heavy breathing and the outstretched arm from your passion. It makes coworkers uncomfortable in the cubicle next to you. Find fascination. Fascination is way better than passion. It's not so sweaty.


> Find the torture you're comfortable with. This is the golden path to victory in life. Work. Exercise. Relationships. They all have a solid component of pure torture, and they are all 1,000% worth it.


> The better the job you've done in finding a path for yourself, the more boring and predictable your life is going to be. The less secure and confident you feel in the direction, the more surprises and excitement you will have in store. That's good.


> The other thing I see going on that throws a lot of people off these days is thinking, I've got to make as much money as I can.
>  I personally believe the real game is I want to have the coolest job.
