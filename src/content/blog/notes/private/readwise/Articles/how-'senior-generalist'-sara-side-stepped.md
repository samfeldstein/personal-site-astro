> ( Honestly, when something really fires you up, you’ll be super keen by default and probably do all the rest anyway. That’s what happened to me ^_^ )


> So I became very broad in what I can do. Frustratingly, breadth without specific depth is very hard to sell. People who can turn their hand to many things can struggle to find a niche, or a job that recognises their true worth. This would make me a good candidate to be an entrepreneur, probably, but I don’t want to be one! People like me do however fit well into small companies, as often you end up with your fingers in many pies when there are only a few of you.


> For those coming from such a generalist background, it can be hard to work out just what you actually want to do. And even if you do work that part out, your history may not reflect experience in that thing. You end up in a weird position of being both overqualified and underqualified for most positions, and unable to prove yourself.


> More fun, and what I tend to do first before using some kind of UI design program like Figma, is code up the basic structure and then make it look good, or copy an existing design as perfectly as possible - it’s like a great puzzle.

Reading other people gives you permission to work the way you want to.


> I almost felt dumb not to have realised this before. It’s a web developer job. Why wouldn’t you make a little website as an application? Why? I mean, it’s just obvious, isn’t it?


> Another thing that I’m sure helped, was that I took interest in what the company does, and asked people I knew who happened to be in the market for it, whether they had heard of it. Several of them had, and I asked them if they had any feedback about the service - and I put that information into this application mini site. This is not always possible, of course.


> My response was basically too cute and too keen for them to ignore. I’d gone to the trouble to replicate their style as best I could. My slightly dodgy German wasn’t a problem, thankfully.


> I got more bites when I sent these in a chatty, effusive email directly to the recruiting person. But none of them had got me so fired up as this!
