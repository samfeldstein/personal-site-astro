> Something that irritates you and won’t let you go. That’s the anguish of it. Do this book, or die. You have to go through that. Talent is insignificant. I know a lot of talented ruins. Beyond talent lie all the usual words: discipline, love, luck, but most of all, endurance.

I can relate to this a little. Only it isn’t ideas that get ahold of me, it’s just the desire to do the act. So maybe in that sense, I’m not a writer. Maybe I don’t care so much about coming up with good stories. Maybe I care more about telling them. A storyteller can tell any story. It doesn’t have to be one they made up.


> If you are going to be a writer there is nothing I can say to stop you; if you’re not going to be a writer nothing I can say will help you. What you really need at the beginning is somebody to let you know that the effort is real.
