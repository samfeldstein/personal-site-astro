> To train yourself, start small. If possible, first do the incremental-hacking cycle as an exercise on very small programs or scripts, 10-50 lines. These may be hard to find, as most programs of any use are larger than this. Most programs this small are scripts in shell, Perl, Python, or Tcl; that's a trait to look for when trawling the Web for them.
>  When you have done the incremental-hacking cycle on several very small programs (or if you are unlucky enough to not find any suitable very small ones), try it on slightly larger programs. Look for codebases in the range of 100-500 lines.
>  When you master that level, go to the order of magnitude, 1000-5000 lines. By the time you master the 1K-5K level, you will have entered the bottom end of the capability range of what is usually considered a skilled programmer.
