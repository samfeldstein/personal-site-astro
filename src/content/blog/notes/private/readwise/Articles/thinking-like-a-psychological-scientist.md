> Popper argued against statements that could not be falsified. He claimed that they blocked scientific progress: There was no way to advance, refine, or refute knowledge based on such claims. Popper’s solution was a powerful one: *If science showed all the possibilities that were not true, we would be left only with what is true.* That is, we need to be able to articulate—beforehand—the kinds of evidence that will disprove our hypothesis and cause us to abandon it.


> Proof is more associated with deductive reasoning. [Deductive reasoning](https://nobaproject.com/modules/thinking-like-a-psychological-scientist#vocabulary-deductive-reasoning) starts with general principles that are applied to specific instances (the reverse of inductive reasoning). When the general principles, or *premises*, are true, and the structure of the argument is valid, the conclusion is, by definition, *proven;* it must be so.


> [Null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST)](https://nobaproject.com/modules/thinking-like-a-psychological-scientist#vocabulary-null-hypothesis-significance-testing-nhst) assesses the probability that the collected data (the observations) would be the same if there were no relationship between the variables in the study.


> *null hypothesis,* a statement that two variables are *not* related


> There are a couple of ways that research conclusions might be wrong. One is referred to as a [type I error](https://nobaproject.com/modules/thinking-like-a-psychological-scientist#vocabulary-type-i-error)—when the researcher concludes there *is* a relationship between two variables but, in reality, there is *not*.


> a [type II error](https://nobaproject.com/modules/thinking-like-a-psychological-scientist#vocabulary-type-ii-error), when the data fail to show a relationship between variables that actually exists.


> psychological science doesn’t rely on definitive proof; it’s about the probability of seeing a specific result.


> researchers consider how to best prepare and measure their subjects, systematically collect data from large and—ideally—representative samples, and test their findings against probability.


> starting with a general principle (students do not like to pay for textbooks) it is possible to make a prediction about likely student behavior (they will not purchase textbooks). Note that this is a case of prediction rather than using observations.

So the difference between a principle and an observation is a matter of specificity.
