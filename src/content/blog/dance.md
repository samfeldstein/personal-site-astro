I've been dancing West Coast Swing for about five months now. I started in I think June in New Orleans, but then I spent August at home and there's no WCS in Des Moines. So I didn't take it up again until October, when I rented a place in Boulder. And by that time, I was in dire need of a refresher.

So I'm learning. And when I learn a thing, it helps me to try and figure out what the thing *actually is.*

I've written about this before in a post called [What Is Rain](../what-is-rain/), though I'm not sure how well I articulated it there. But the idea is to try to cut to the core of an object or an entity or a process and identify the fundamental shape or phenomenon underlying it. In other words, **you try to see the forest for the trees**.

In storytelling, they call it subtext. There's what's happening, and there's what's *happening.* There's what a story's about, and there's what a story's *about.* *The Dark Knight* is about a crazy man dressed as a bat fighting a crazy man dressed as a clown. But *The Dark Knight* is *about* order versus chaos.[^3]

[*Oppenheimer*](https://youtu.be/qiuSBWVdgLI?si=02sJJod6FA9kdgK6) (the movie, not the human) articulates it beautifully: Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh) says to Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy): *The important thing isn't can you read music, it's can you hear it?* ***Can you hear the music, Robert?***

This post is me trying to "hear the music", as it pertains to dance, and it turns out the analogy is so apt it's not even an analogy. "Hearing the music" in dance really means *hearing the music.* Dancing is singing with the body. Without the music, there is no song to sing.

## What *is* Dance?

Two fish swim past each other. One says, *Mornin' there! How's the water?* The other says, *What's water?*[^1]

It's hard to see an object from inside the object. In dance, it's easy to get lost in the weeds of footwork, frame, and connection. These things matter, but they amount to nothing if you lose sight of the big picture.

Dancing is singing with the body.
 
You aren't dancing *to* the music. You're dancing with the music. You're trying to *become* the music. If aliens came down, they should think that the music was coming *from* you. You are the music. You close your eyes and try to take the music inside you, and let it do the dancing.

Okay, that's the individual perspective. But West Coast is a partnered dance. That changes things, but how?

## Dancing is structure

I'm finding it helpful to think of stars and planets. In that sense that planets are linked by an unbreakable force, consistent force, balanced force, which locks them in orbit and allows them to move in harmony.

The difference between dancers and stars and planets is that dance is dynamic, where stars and planets are predictable and constant (apologies if I'm underappreciating celestial forces here).

So I think what you have to do is attune yourself to your center of gravity, then attune your center of gravity to your partner's center of gravity. I assume it's ideal when both partners are trying to do this.

## Going Foward

If I want to get better at dancing, I'll probably have to deepen my understanding and appreciation for music.
