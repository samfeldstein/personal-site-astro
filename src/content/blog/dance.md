I've been dancing West Coast Swing for about five months now. I started in I think June in New Orleans, but then I spent August at home and there's no WCS in Des Moines. So I didn't take it up again until October, when I rented a place in Boulder. And by that time, I was in dire need of a refresher.

So I'm learning. And when I learn a thing, it helps me to try and figure out what the thing *is.* I've written about this before in a post called [What Is Rain](../what-is-rain/), though I'm not sure how well I articulated it there. But the idea is to try to cut to the core of an object of an entity or a process, and to try to identity the fundmental shape or phenomenon underlying. You try to see the forest for the trees, in other words.

So the example I gave in that other piece was a car. What's a car? What is the *essence* of a car? How do you articulate the *idea* of a car? And the answer I gave was: *A car is a chair with four wheels and an engine.* I don't know if that's the most clever answer, but I think it's at least the right idea. When you put the trees out of mind, you can begin to appreciate the forest as an entity unto itself. To paraphrase *Oppenheimer* (the movie, not the human): *We know you can do the math, but can you hear the music?*

## Dancing is singing with the body

Dancing is singing with the body.
 
You aren't dancing *to* the music. You're dancing with the music. You're trying to *become* the music. If aliens came down, they should think that the music was coming *from* you. You are the music. You close your eyes and try to take the music inside you, and let it do the dancing.

Okay, that's the individual perspective. But West Coast is a partnered dance. That changes things, but how?

## Dancing is structure

I'm finding it helpful to think of stars and planets. In that sense that planets are linked by an unbreakable force, consistent force, balanced force, which locks them in orbit and allows them to move in harmony.

The difference between dancers and stars and planets is that dance is dynamic, where stars and planets are predictable and constant (apologies if I'm underappreciating celestial forces here).

So I think what you have to do is attune yourself to your center of gravity, then attune your center of gravity to your partner's center of gravity. I assume it's ideal when both partners are trying to do this.
