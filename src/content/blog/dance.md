I've been dancing West Coast Swing for about five months now. I started in I think June in New Orleans, but then I spent August at home and there's no WCS in Des Moines, so I didn't take it up again until October when I rented a place in Boulder. By that time I was in dire need of a refresher.

So I'm learning. And when I learn a thing, it helps me to try and **figure out what the thing *actually is.*** I've written about this before in a post called [What Is Rain](../what-is-rain/), though I'm not sure how well I articulated it there. But basically what you do is try to cut to the core of an idea and identify the fundamental structure or process underlying it.

In that other piece the example was, *What is a car?* And the answer (taken from my poetry professor) was, *A car is a chair with four wheels.*

I hope that doesn't make this look like a reductive process; it should be just the opposite. What we're trying to do is capture the totality of an idea in a single definition. If we're doing it right, **the definition will appear unconventional but ring true**.

Although, now that I'm thinking about it, that's impossible. You can't "capture" an idea any more than you can "capture" a cloud. So we're not capturing the idea. We're building the key. The definition is the key to the door to the room, and in the room is the idea.



In other words, **you try to see the forest for the trees**.

In storytelling, these fundamental shapes are called *metanarratives*. There's what's happening, and there's what's *happening.* There's what a story's about, and there's what a story's *about.* *The Dark Knight* is about a crazy man dressed as a bat fighting a crazy man dressed as a clown. But *The Dark Knight* is *about* order versus chaos.[^3]

The metanarrative is what makes a story tangible.

In general, there are two types of knowledge: *declarative knowledge* and *procedural knowledge*. Declarative knowledge is anything you can learn from a book (example: *The sky is blue*). Procedural knowledge is anything you can't learn from a book.

> Our current conventional wisdom is thoroughly ambivalent on this, largely owing to popular acceptance of Nonaka and Takeuchi’s mid-1990s description of ‘tacit knowledge’ and ‘explicit knowledge’ and their SECI (Socialization, Externalization, Combination, Internalization) model of how one is transmuted into the other.

The semnatics are a little confusing here: Knowledge, as distinct from understanding. Or information, as distinct from knowledge.

Taoism calls it *conventional knowledge* (knowledge that can be represented with symbols) and...something else.

[*Oppenheimer*](https://youtu.be/qiuSBWVdgLI?si=02sJJod6FA9kdgK6) (the movie, not the human) articulates it beautifully: Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh) says to Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy): *The important thing isn't can you read music, it's can you hear it?* ***Can you hear the music, Robert?***

So this is me trying to "hear the music", as it pertains to dance. It's possible the analogy is so apt it's not even an analogy. "Hearing the music" in dance really means *hearing the music.* There's a reason we don't dance to silence. **Dancing is singing with the body**. Without the music, there is no song to sing.

## What *is* Dance?

Two fish swim past each other. One says, *Mornin' there! How's the water?* The other says, *What's water?*[^1]

It's hard to see an object from inside the object. In dance, it's easy to get lost in the weeds of footwork, frame, and connection. These things matter, but they amount to nothing if you lose sight of the big picture. You can't play with a form if you don't even know it exists.
 
You aren't dancing *to* the music. You're dancing with the music. You're trying to *become* the music. If aliens came down, they should think that the music was coming *from* you. You are the music. You close your eyes and try to take the music inside you, and let it do the dancing.

Okay, that's the individual perspective. But West Coast is a partnered dance. That changes things, but how?

## Dancing is structure

I'm finding it helpful to think of stars and planets. In that sense that planets are linked by an unbreakable force, consistent force, balanced force, which locks them in orbit and allows them to move in harmony.

The difference between dancers and stars and planets is that dance is dynamic, where stars and planets are predictable and constant (apologies if I'm underappreciating celestial forces here).

So I think what you have to do is attune yourself to your center of gravity, then attune your center of gravity to your partner's center of gravity. I assume it's ideal when both partners are trying to do this.

## Going Foward

If I want to get better at dancing, I'll probably have to deepen my understanding and appreciation for music.
