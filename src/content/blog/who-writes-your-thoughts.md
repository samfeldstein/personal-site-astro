Who writes your thoughts?  
Presumably, you.  
But how can you author a thought  
before you have it?

To do that, you'd have to know  
what you were going to think  
before you thought it.  
And if you knew  
what you were going to think  
before you thought it,  
you'd have already thought it.  
In that case, there would be no  
before-the-thought  
or after-the-thought.  

But there is a before-the-thought  
and an after-the-thought.  
Therefore, "you"  
(in the sense that we mean)  
can't have written the thought.  
But if not "you"  
who?
